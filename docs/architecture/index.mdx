# Architecture

This section provides a comprehensive overview of our system architecture, explaining how different components work together to create a robust and scalable platform.

## Contents

- [Overview](/architecture/overview) - High-level architectural overview
- [Layered Architecture](/architecture/layers) - Detailed explanation of our layered approach
- [Architecture Diagrams](/architecture/diagrams) - Visual representations of system components
- [Architecture Comparison](/architecture/comparison) - How our architecture compares to alternatives

## Key Architectural Principles

Our architecture is built on several key principles:

- **Modularity**: Components are designed to be self-contained and reusable
- **Scalability**: The system can grow to handle increased load
- **Security**: Security is built into every layer
- **Resilience**: The system can recover from failures
- **Maintainability**: Code and components are designed for long-term maintenance

## Architecture Overview

Our system uses a layered architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

\```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Layer] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Service Layer]
    C --> D[Data Access Layer]
    D --> E[Storage Layer]
    C --> F[Integration Layer]
    F --> G[External Services]
\```

Each layer has specific responsibilities and communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.
