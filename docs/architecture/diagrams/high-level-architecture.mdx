## Component Descriptions

### Client Applications

The entry points for users to interact with our system:

- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Desktop clients
- Third-party integrations

### API Gateway

The central entry point for all client requests:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation

### Core Services

Our system includes several core microservices:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Transaction Service**: Processes financial transactions
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and analyzes system data

### Blockchain Adapters

Specialized components that interface with blockchain networks:

- Abstract blockchain-specific details
- Handle transaction signing and verification
- Manage blockchain state synchronization
- Implement retry and fallback mechanisms

### Data Storage

Various data storage systems used by our services:

- Relational databases for structured data
- NoSQL databases for flexible schema data
- Data warehouse for analytics
- Blockchain for immutable records
