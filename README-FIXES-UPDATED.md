# Docusaurus Project Fix Guide (Updated)

This guide addresses several issues with the VeritasVault Docusaurus project that were preventing a successful build. The fixes are organized into four main categories:

1. **MDX Syntax Errors**: Fixed issues with code blocks and template literals in MDX files
2. **Missing Theme Components**: Added required Docusaurus theme components
3. **Path Alias Resolution**: Fixed webpack configuration for proper path resolution
4. **Missing UI Components**: Created required UI components referenced in the project

## Identified Issues and Solutions

### 1. MDX Syntax Errors

**Issues:**
- Nested template literals in code blocks causing parsing errors
- Escaped backticks in markdown files confusing the MDX parser
- Unclosed braces in expressions

**Solution:**
We created a script (`fix-mdx-syntax.js`) to automatically fix these issues.

### 2. Missing Theme Components

**Issues:**
- Many missing Docusaurus theme components like:
  - `@theme/Root`
  - `@theme/SiteMetadata`
  - `@theme/Loading`
  - `@theme/Tabs`
  - `@theme/TabItem`
  - And many more

**Solution:**
- Created a script (`create-theme-components.js`) that creates the essential theme components directly in the correct location
- Added custom implementations for critical components like Tabs and TabItem

### 3. Path Alias Resolution

**Issues:**
- Imports using `@/components/ui/card` and similar path aliases were not resolving

**Solution:**
- Updated webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`) to properly set up path aliases

### 4. Missing UI Components

**Issues:**
- Missing UI components like card, table, etc.
- Missing custom docs components referenced in MDX files

**Solution:**
- Created missing UI components in the appropriate directories
- Created custom docs components that were referenced in MDX files:
  - `SectionLevelOne`
  - `ContentBlock`
  - `CodeBlock`
  - `Admonition`

## How to Apply the Fixes

Follow these steps in order to apply all the fixes:

### Step 1: Fix MDX Syntax Issues

Run the MDX syntax fix script:

```bash
node fix-mdx-syntax.js
```

This will automatically fix syntax issues in the problematic MDX files.

### Step 2: Create Missing Theme Components

Instead of using the swizzle command (which was causing errors), run the theme component creation script:

```bash
node create-theme-components.js
```

This script will create all the essential theme components directly in the correct location: `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/`.

### Step 3: Update Webpack Configuration

The `webpack.config.js` file has been updated to properly resolve path aliases. Make sure this file is in your project root directory and that it's being used by Docusaurus.

If you already have a webpack configuration file, merge the aliases from our `webpack.config.js` into your existing file.

### Step 4: Verify UI and Doc Components

We've created several components that were missing:

**UI Components:**
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/ui/table.tsx`

**Theme Components:**
- `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/Tabs/index.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/TabItem/index.tsx`
- Other essential theme components (Root, NotFound, Error, etc.)

**Doc Components:**
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/docs/SectionLevelOne.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/docs/ContentBlock.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/docs/CodeBlock.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/docs/Admonition.tsx`

Make sure these files are present and properly imported where needed.

### Step 5: Update Package.json (if needed)

If you're missing any dependencies, install them:

```bash
npm install clsx
```

### Step 6: Run the Build

After applying all fixes, run the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting Common Errors

If you encounter errors after applying these fixes, here are some common issues and solutions:

### 1. "Cannot find module '@theme/X'"

This means a theme component is still missing. Look at the specific component mentioned in the error and:

1. Check if it exists in `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/`
2. If not, create it using a similar pattern to the other theme components
3. You can reference the official Docusaurus theme components for implementation details

### 2. "Cannot find module '@/components/ui/X'"

This means a UI component is still missing:

1. Create the component in `veritasvault-docs/src/components/ui/`
2. Make sure the webpack aliases are properly configured

### 3. MDX Syntax Errors Still Occurring

Some MDX files might need manual fixes:

1. Look for nested template literals (backticks within backticks)
2. Check for unclosed braces in JSX expressions
3. Make sure code blocks use regular triple backticks, not escaped backticks
