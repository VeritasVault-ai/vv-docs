# Docusaurus Project Fix Guide

This guide addresses several issues with the VeritasVault Docusaurus project that were preventing a successful build. The fixes are organized into four main categories:

1. **MDX Syntax Errors**: Fixed issues with code blocks and template literals in MDX files
2. **Missing Theme Components**: Added required Docusaurus theme components
3. **Path Alias Resolution**: Fixed webpack configuration for proper path resolution
4. **Missing UI Components**: Created required UI components referenced in the project

## Identified Issues and Solutions

### 1. MDX Syntax Errors

**Issues:**
- Nested template literals in code blocks causing parsing errors
- Escaped backticks in markdown files confusing the MDX parser
- Unclosed braces in expressions

**Solution:**
We created a script (`fix-mdx-syntax.js`) to automatically fix these issues.

### 2. Missing Theme Components

**Issues:**
- Many missing Docusaurus theme components like:
  - `@theme/Root`
  - `@theme/SiteMetadata`
  - `@theme/Loading`
  - `@theme/Tabs`
  - `@theme/TabItem`
  - And many more

**Solution:**
- Created a script (`swizzle-components.js`) to swizzle these components
- Added custom implementations for critical components like Tabs and TabItem

### 3. Path Alias Resolution

**Issues:**
- Imports using `@/components/ui/card` and similar path aliases were not resolving

**Solution:**
- Updated webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`) to properly set up path aliases

### 4. Missing UI Components

**Issues:**
- Missing UI components like card, table, etc.

**Solution:**
- Created missing UI components in the appropriate directories

## How to Apply the Fixes

Follow these steps in order to apply all the fixes:

### Step 1: Fix MDX Syntax Issues

Run the MDX syntax fix script:

```bash
node fix-mdx-syntax.js
```

This will automatically fix syntax issues in the problematic MDX files.

### Step 2: Swizzle Missing Theme Components

Run the script to swizzle the missing theme components:

```bash
node swizzle-components.js
```

Note: Some components may need additional configuration. The script has been set up to handle errors gracefully.

### Step 3: Update Webpack Configuration

The `webpack.config.js` file has been updated to properly resolve path aliases. Make sure this file is in your project root directory and that it's being used by Docusaurus.

If you already have a webpack configuration file, merge the aliases from our `webpack.config.js` into your existing file.

### Step 4: Verify UI Components

We've created several UI components that were missing:

- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/ui/card.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/components/ui/table.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/Tabs/index.tsx`
- `veritasvault-docs/src/theme/TabItem/index.tsx`

Make sure these files are present and properly imported where needed.

### Step 5: Update Package.json (if needed)

If you're missing any dependencies, install them:

```bash
npm install clsx
```

### Step 6: Run the Build

After applying all fixes, run the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Additional Tips

If you're still encountering issues:

1. **Check the Docusaurus Version**: Make sure you're using the same version of Docusaurus components throughout your project.

2. **Review MDX Files**: If there are still MDX syntax errors, manually review the files mentioned in the error messages.

3. **Missing Icons**: Some components reference icons that might be missing. Add appropriate icon components if needed.

4. **Customize Theme Components**: If the swizzled components don't match your design needs, customize them accordingly.
