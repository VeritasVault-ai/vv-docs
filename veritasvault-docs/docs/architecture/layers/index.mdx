# Layered Architecture

<ContentBlock>
  Our system uses a layered architecture approach to organize components and establish clear separation of concerns.
  Each layer has specific responsibilities and communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.

## Architecture Layers

</DiagramBlock>

Our architecture consists of the following layers:

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for:

- User interface components
- Client-side validation
- State management
- User experience

### API Layer

The API layer serves as the entry point for all client requests:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- API documentation

### Service Layer

The service layer contains the core business logic:

- Business rules implementation
- Transaction management
- Domain-specific operations
- Service orchestration

### Data Access Layer

The data access layer handles interactions with data storage:

- Database operations
- Data mapping
- Query optimization
- Caching strategies

### Storage Layer

The storage layer represents the actual data storage systems:

- Relational databases
- NoSQL databases
- Blockchain storage
- File storage

### Integration Layer

The integration layer manages interactions with external systems:

- API clients
- Blockchain adapters
- Message queues
- Event processing

    { layer: "Data Access", responsibility: "Data storage interactions", components: "Repositories, ORM, Query Builders" },
    { layer: "Storage", responsibility: "Physical data storage", components: "Databases, Blockchain, File Systems" },
    { layer: "Integration", responsibility: "External system communication", components: "API Clients, Adapters, Event Handlers" }
  ]}
/>

<SectionAnchor id="communication-patterns" />

## Communication Patterns

Communication between layers follows these patterns:

### Request-Response

The most common pattern, where:

- Upper layer makes a request to a lower layer
- Lower layer processes the request and returns a response
- Synchronous communication

### Event-Driven

Used for asynchronous operations:

- Layer publishes events when state changes
- Interested layers subscribe to relevant events
- Decouples components and improves scalability

### Dependency Injection

Used to manage dependencies between layers:

- Dependencies are provided to components rather than created
- Improves testability and flexibility
- Reduces tight coupling between layers

## Benefits of Layered Architecture

Our layered approach provides several key benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others
- **Testability**: Layers can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: Layers can be scaled independently
- **Flexibility**: Components can be replaced without affecting the entire system
