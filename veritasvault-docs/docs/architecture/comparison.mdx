# Architecture Comparison

<ContentBlock>
  This section compares our architecture with alternative approaches, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs of each option.
</ContentBlock>

<SectionAnchor id="architecture-approaches" />

## Architecture Approaches

We evaluated several architectural approaches before selecting our current design:

### Microservices Architecture

Our chosen approach, with services organized around business capabilities.

### Monolithic Architecture

A single, unified codebase containing all functionality.

### Serverless Architecture

Function-based architecture with no server management.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Services organized around shared enterprise services.

<SectionAnchor id="key-considerations" />

## Key Considerations

### Scalability

- **Our Microservices**: Each service can scale independently based on demand
- **Monolithic**: Entire application must scale together, leading to resource inefficiency
- **Serverless**: Automatic scaling with no management, but with cold start penalties
- **SOA**: Services can scale independently but often have shared resources

### Development Speed

- **Our Microservices**: Initial overhead but faster long-term development
- **Monolithic**: Fast initial development but slows as complexity increases
- **Serverless**: Rapid development with minimal infrastructure concerns
- **SOA**: Slower development due to service contract negotiations

### Technology Flexibility

- **Our Microservices**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Monolithic**: Single technology stack for the entire application
- **Serverless**: Limited by cloud provider offerings
- **SOA**: Some flexibility but often constrained by enterprise standards

## Blockchain Integration Considerations

### Our Microservices Approach

- Dedicated blockchain integration services
- Abstraction layers for multiple blockchain support
- Specialized scaling for blockchain operations
- Isolated failure domains

### Alternative Approaches

- **Monolithic**: Blockchain integration embedded in the main application
- **Serverless**: Blockchain operations as functions with potential timeout issues
- **SOA**: Blockchain as an enterprise service with standardized interfaces

<SectionAnchor id="why-we-chose-microservices" />

## Why We Chose Microservices

We selected a microservices architecture for several key reasons:

1. **Scalability**: Ability to scale services independently based on demand
2. **Resilience**: Isolated failure domains prevent system-wide outages
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Freedom to use the best technology for each service
4. **Team Organization**: Allows teams to own and develop services independently
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Better support for specialized blockchain services

## Architecture Evolution

Our architecture has evolved over time:

1. **Initial Prototype**: Monolithic application for rapid development
2. **First Production**: Core services extracted into microservices
3. **Current Architecture**: Full microservices with specialized blockchain services
4. **Future Direction**: Hybrid approach with some serverless components
