# Architecture Overview

<ContentBlock>
  This document provides a high-level overview of our system architecture, explaining the main components and how they interact.
  
  Our architecture follows modern best practices for distributed systems, with a focus on scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

## High-Level Architecture

<DiagramBlock title="High-Level System Architecture">
  \```mermaid

    A[Client Applications] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Authentication Service]
    B --> D[Transaction Service]
    B --> E[Analytics Service]
    D --> F[Blockchain Adapters]
    F --> G[Multiple Blockchains]
    E --> H[Data Warehouse]
  \```
</DiagramBlock>

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Client Applications**: Web, mobile, and desktop interfaces
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Microservices**: Specialized services for authentication, transactions, and analytics
- **Blockchain Adapters**: Interfaces to various blockchain networks
- **Data Warehouse**: Centralized repository for analytics and reporting

## Key Components

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation

### Microservices

Our system is built on a microservices architecture, with services including:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Transaction Service**: Processes financial transactions
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and analyzes system data

### Blockchain Integration

Our platform integrates with multiple blockchain networks through specialized adapters that:

- Abstract blockchain-specific details
- Handle transaction signing and verification
- Manage blockchain state synchronization
- Implement retry and fallback mechanisms

## Data Flow

<DiagramBlock title="System Data Flow">
  \```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Gateway
    participant Service
    participant Blockchain
    
    User->>Gateway: Request
    Gateway->>Service: Forward Request
    Service->>Blockchain: Submit Transaction
    Blockchain-->>Service: Confirmation
    Service-->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway-->>User: Result
  \```
</DiagramBlock>

The typical data flow through the system follows these steps:

1. User initiates a request through a client application
2. API Gateway authenticates and routes the request
3. Appropriate microservice processes the request
4. If needed, the service interacts with blockchain adapters
5. Results are returned through the API Gateway to the client
