## Integration Components

### Blockchain Service

The central service that coordinates blockchain interactions:

- Exposes a unified API for blockchain operations
- Manages transaction lifecycle
- Handles blockchain state synchronization
- Implements retry and fallback mechanisms

### Blockchain Adapter Interface

A common interface implemented by all blockchain adapters:

- Defines standard methods for blockchain interactions
- Abstracts blockchain-specific details
- Enables easy addition of new blockchain support
- Provides consistent error handling

### Blockchain Adapters

Specialized components for each supported blockchain:

- **Ethereum Adapter**: Interacts with Ethereum networks
- **Solana Adapter**: Interacts with Solana networks
- **Polygon Adapter**: Interacts with Polygon networks
- **Other Chain Adapters**: Support for additional blockchains

### Transaction Manager

Manages the lifecycle of blockchain transactions:

- Queues transactions for processing
- Monitors transaction status
- Handles transaction retries
- Provides transaction history

### State Synchronizer

Keeps the system's view of blockchain state up-to-date:

- Listens for blockchain events
- Updates local state cache
- Handles chain reorganizations
- Provides consistent state views

    participant App as Application
    participant BS as Blockchain Service
    participant TM as Transaction Manager
    participant BA as Blockchain Adapter
    participant BC as Blockchain
    
    App->>BS: Submit Transaction
    BS->>TM: Queue Transaction
    TM->>BA: Prepare Transaction
    BA->>BC: Submit to Blockchain
    BC-->>BA: Transaction Hash
    BA-->>TM: Update Status (Pending)
    TM-->>BS: Transaction Submitted

    SS->>SC: Update State Cache
    
    App->>BS: Request State
    BS->>SC: Get Cached State
    SC-->>BS: Current State
    BS-->>App: State Response
