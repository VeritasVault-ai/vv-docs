# Architecture Diagrams

<ContentBlock>
  This section provides visual representations of our system architecture through various diagrams.
  These diagrams help illustrate the structure, components, and interactions within our system.

<SectionAnchor id="available-diagrams" />

## Available Diagrams

We provide the following architecture diagrams:

- [High-Level Architecture](/architecture/diagrams/high-level-architecture) - Overview of the main system components
- [Layered Architecture](/architecture/diagrams/layered-architecture) - Detailed view of our architectural layers
- [Cloud Infrastructure](/architecture/diagrams/cloud-infrastructure) - Cloud deployment architecture
- [Blockchain Integration](/architecture/diagrams/blockchain-integration) - How our system integrates with blockchain networks
- [Data Flow](/architecture/diagrams/data-flow) - How data moves through the system

<SectionAnchor id="diagram-types" />

## Diagram Types

Our architecture documentation includes several types of diagrams:

### Component Diagrams

Component diagrams show the high-level components of the system and their relationships.

### Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams illustrate how components interact over time to accomplish specific tasks.

### Deployment Diagrams

Deployment diagrams show how software components are deployed to hardware infrastructure.

### Data Flow Diagrams

Data flow diagrams illustrate how data moves through the system.

## Using These Diagrams

These diagrams serve several purposes:

- **Understanding the System**: Get a visual overview of how the system works
- **Planning Changes**: Assess the impact of proposed changes
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the architecture
- **Documentation**: Provide reference material for implementation
