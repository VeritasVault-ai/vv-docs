## Layer Details

### Presentation Layer

Components that directly interact with users:

- Web UI components
- Mobile UI components
- Admin dashboard
- Client-side validation
- State management

### API Layer

The interface between client applications and backend services:

- API Gateway
- Controllers
- Middleware
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization

### Service Layer

Contains the core business logic of the application:

- Service classes
- Domain models
- Business rules
- Validators
- Orchestrators

### Data Access Layer

Manages interactions with data storage systems:

- Repositories
- Data mappers
- Query builders
- Caching mechanisms
- Transaction management

### Storage Layer

The actual data storage systems:

- Relational databases
- NoSQL databases
- Blockchain storage
- File storage
- Cache stores

### Integration Layer

Handles communication with external systems:

- API clients
- Blockchain adapters
- Message producers/consumers
- Event handlers
- External service proxies

## Layer Interactions

Interactions between layers follow these principles:

1. Each layer depends only on the layer directly below it
2. Lower layers have no knowledge of higher layers
3. Communication happens through well-defined interfaces
4. Cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, etc.) span multiple layers
