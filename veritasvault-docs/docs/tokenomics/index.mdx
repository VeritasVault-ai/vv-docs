    ## Introduction to Tokenomics

    The multi-chain architecture is powered by a dual-token system designed to align incentives, enable governance, and create sustainable economic value. Our tokenomics model is built on sound economic principles adapted for the unique requirements of a multi-chain ecosystem.

    ## Token System

    Our architecture employs two complementary tokens:

    ### VVAI (VeritasVault.ai) Token

    The VVAI token is the primary governance token of the ecosystem with the following characteristics:

    - **Type**: Governance and utility token
    - **Supply**: 100,000,000 VVAI (fixed supply)
    - **Standard**: ERC-20 compatible, deployed on multiple chains
    - **Utility**: Governance voting, staking, fee discounts, protocol access

    ### VV-X (VeritasVault Utility) Token

    The VV-X token is the utility token used for network operations:

    - **Type**: Utility and work token
    - **Supply**: Dynamic supply with controlled inflation
    - **Standard**: Multi-chain native token
    - **Utility**: Transaction fees, validator rewards, cross-chain operations

    ## Token Distribution

    The initial distribution of VVAI tokens is designed to ensure broad participation and aligned incentives:

    <TokenDistributionChart
      data={{
        labels: ['Community Treasury', 'Team and Advisors', 'Investors', 'Ecosystem Development', 'Public Sale'],
        datasets: [{
          data: [40, 15, 20, 15, 10],
          backgroundColor: [
            '#3B82F6',
            '#10B981',
            '#F59E0B',
            '#6366F1',
            '#EC4899'
          ]
        }]
      }}
      height={300}
    />

    - **Community Treasury (40%)**: Controlled by DAO governance for ecosystem growth
    - **Team and Advisors (15%)**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
    - **Investors (20%)**: Strategic and seed investors with vesting schedules
    - **Ecosystem Development (15%)**: Grants, hackathons, and developer incentives
    - **Public Sale (10%)**: Initial token offering to the public

    ## Token Utility

    The VVAI token provides multiple utilities within the ecosystem:

    ### Governance

    Token holders can participate in governance by:

    - Proposing protocol upgrades and parameter changes
    - Voting on improvement proposals
    - Delegating voting power to trusted representatives
    - Participating in specialized governance committees

    ### Staking

    Staking VVAI tokens provides several benefits:

    - Earning a share of protocol fees
    - Boosting yields in DeFi protocols
    - Accessing premium features and services
    - Reducing transaction fees across the network

    ### Protocol Access

    VVAI tokens enable access to premium protocol features:

    - Priority transaction processing
    - Advanced analytics and market data
    - Higher transaction limits
    - Access to beta features and tools

    ## Economic Model

    Our economic model is designed for long-term sustainability:

    ### Fee Structure

    The protocol generates revenue through several fee types:

    - **Transaction Fees**: Fees for cross-chain transactions
    - **Bridge Fees**: Fees for asset transfers between chains
    - **Service Fees**: Fees for specialized services
    - **Subscription Fees**: Recurring fees for premium features

    ### Fee Distribution

    Collected fees are distributed as follows:

    - **Stakers (50%)**: Distributed to VVAI stakers
    - **Treasury (30%)**: Added to the community treasury
    - **Burn Mechanism (10%)**: Tokens burned to reduce supply
    - **Development Fund (10%)**: Allocated for ongoing development

    ### Token Burn Mechanism

    The protocol implements a systematic token burn mechanism:

    - A percentage of transaction fees are used to buy back and burn VVAI
    - Tokens are burned based on network usage and growth
    - Burn rate adjusts dynamically based on market conditions
    - Quarterly burn events with transparent reporting

    ## Governance Framework

    The governance system evolves through three phases:

    ### Phase 1: Foundation Governance

    - Core team maintains admin keys with community oversight
    - Major decisions require community approval
    - Transparent governance process with public discussions

    ### Phase 2: Hybrid Governance

    - Introduction of on-chain governance for key parameters
    - Formation of specialized governance committees
    - Gradual transition of authority to the DAO

    ### Phase 3: Full DAO Governance

    - Complete transition to on-chain governance
    - Tiered governance system for different decision types
    - Cross-chain governance coordination
