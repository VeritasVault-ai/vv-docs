# URL Structure and Redirects

This document outlines our URL structure and redirect strategy for the Docusaurus migration.

## URL Structure Principles

Our URL structure follows these key principles:

1. **Consistency**: All documentation URLs follow a consistent pattern
2. **Semantics**: URLs reflect the content hierarchy and meaning
3. **Simplicity**: URLs are kept as simple and readable as possible
4. **Permanence**: Once published, URLs should not change

## Base URL Pattern

All documentation pages follow a standard pattern with the following components:

- A `/docs/` prefix (Docusaurus standard)
- A section identifier (main category)
- An optional subsection identifier
- An optional page name (defaults to index)

## Section URL Mapping

| Section | Pattern Description |
|---------|---------------------|
| Overview | Main overview section |
| Architecture | Architecture documentation with subsections |
| Tokenomics | Tokenomics documentation with subsections |
| Security | Security documentation with subsections |
| Finance Models | Finance models documentation with subsections |
| Technical Infrastructure | Technical documentation with subsections |
| Integrations | Integration documentation with type subsections |
| Governance Framework | Governance documentation with subsections |
| Implementation Roadmap | Roadmap documentation with phase subsections |
| Gaming Technologies | Gaming documentation with subsections |

## Subsection Examples

**Architecture subsections:**
- Overview
- Layers
- Diagrams

**Tokenomics subsections:**
- Distribution
- Utility
- Economics
- Governance

## Special Pages

Some pages have special URL patterns:

- PDF Preview
- Version Information
- Admin Pages

## Redirect Strategy

To maintain backward compatibility, we've implemented redirects from the old Next.js URL structure to the new Docusaurus structure.

### Redirect Mapping

| Old Path (Next.js) | New Path Description |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Home page | Overview documentation |
| Architecture | Architecture documentation |
| Architecture overview | Architecture overview subsection |
| Architecture layers | Architecture layers subsection |
| Tokenomics | Tokenomics documentation |
| Tokenomics distribution | Tokenomics distribution subsection |
| Tokenomics utility | Tokenomics utility subsection |
| Security | Security documentation |
| Finance models | Finance documentation |
| Technical infrastructure | Technical documentation |
| Integrations | Integrations documentation |
| Integrations data providers | Integrations data subsection |
| Integrations wallet | Integrations wallets subsection |
| Integrations blockchain | Integrations blockchain subsection |
| Integrations risk management | Integrations risk subsection |
| Governance framework | Governance documentation |
| Implementation roadmap | Roadmap documentation |
| Gaming technologies | Gaming documentation |
| PDF preview | PDF documentation |
| Tokenomics download | Tokenomics download subsection |
| Document versions | Versions documentation |

### Implementation

Redirects are implemented using Docusaurus's built-in redirect functionality in the configuration file. This ensures that:

1. Users following old links will be automatically redirected to the correct page
2. Search engines will update their indexes to the new URLs
3. No "404 Not Found" errors will occur for previously shared links

## URL Best Practices

When creating new content or linking to existing content:

1. Always use relative links within the documentation
2. For absolute links, use the full path including the prefix
3. Avoid linking to URLs that might change in the future
4. Use descriptive link text that indicates the destination

## Handling Legacy URLs

For any legacy URLs not covered by the standard redirect mapping, we've implemented a fallback strategy:

1. Custom 404 page with helpful navigation
2. Analytics tracking of 404 errors to identify missing redirects
3. Periodic review and addition of new redirects as needed

## Versioned Documentation URLs

For versioned documentation, URLs include:
- A version identifier
- The standard section pattern
- Subsection and page identifiers as needed

The latest version is always available at the root path without a version prefix.

## URL Parameters and Fragments

Our URLs support parameters and fragments:

- Parameters: For view modes and filters
- Fragments: For section navigation

These are preserved when redirecting from old URLs.

## Localized URLs

For internationalized content, URLs include:
- A locale identifier
- The standard documentation path

The default locale (English) doesn't include a locale prefix.

## API Documentation URLs

API documentation follows a slightly different pattern:
- An API identifier
- An optional version
- The endpoint identifier

## Search Engine Optimization

Our URL structure is designed with SEO in mind:

1. URLs are descriptive and keyword-rich
2. We use hyphens to separate words in URLs
3. URLs are kept reasonably short
4. We avoid URL parameters for core content pages
5. Canonical URLs are specified for all pages

## Monitoring and Maintenance

We regularly monitor our URL structure and redirects:

1. Automated tests verify all redirects are working
2. Analytics track 404 errors and redirect usage
3. Periodic reviews ensure the URL structure remains optimal
4. New redirects are added as needed

## Migration Process

During the migration from Next.js to Docusaurus, we followed these steps:

1. Mapped all existing URLs to their new equivalents
2. Implemented redirects in the Docusaurus configuration
3. Updated internal links to use the new URL structure
4. Verified all redirects with automated tests
5. Monitored analytics after launch to catch any missed redirects

## Conclusion

Our URL structure and redirect strategy ensures a seamless transition from the previous platform to Docusaurus while maintaining SEO value and providing a consistent user experience.
