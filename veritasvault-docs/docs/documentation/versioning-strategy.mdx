<SectionLevelOne id="introduction" title="Introduction">
  <ContentBlock>
    A well-defined versioning strategy ensures that users can access documentation relevant to their specific version while allowing the documentation team to evolve content alongside the product. This document outlines a comprehensive versioning strategy for the Multi-chain Architecture documentation.
    
    Effective documentation versioning provides several benefits:
    
    - Users can find information specific to their version
    - Historical documentation remains accessible for legacy users
    - Documentation can evolve alongside the product
    - Breaking changes can be clearly communicated
    - Multiple versions can be maintained simultaneously

<SectionLevelOne id="version-creation-guidelines" title="Version Creation Guidelines">
  <SectionLevelTwo id="when-to-create" title="When to Create a New Version">
    <ContentBlock>
      Create a new documentation version when:
      
      - A major release of the platform occurs (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.0.0)
      - Significant architectural changes are introduced
      - Breaking changes affect user workflows or integration points
      - Long-term support (LTS) versions are released
      
      Avoid creating versions for minor updates or patch releases unless they contain critical changes that affect documentation.
    </ContentBlock>
    
    <Admonition type="tip">
      Not every code release requires a documentation version. Focus on creating versions when there are significant changes that users need to be aware of.
    </Admonition>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
  
  <SectionLevelTwo id="naming-convention" title="Version Naming Convention">
    <ContentBlock>
      Follow semantic versioning principles:
      
      - Use `X.Y.Z` format (Major.Minor.Patch)
      - Documentation versions should align with product versions
      - For pre-releases, use suffixes like `-alpha.1`, `-beta.2`, `-rc.1`
      
      This approach ensures clarity and consistency across your documentation and product releases.

<SectionLevelOne id="version-management-workflow" title="Version Management Workflow">
  <SectionLevelTwo id="initial-setup" title="Initial Setup">
    <ContentBlock>
      1. Begin with all documentation in the `docs/` directory (unversioned)
      2. Develop and refine documentation until ready for first release
      3. Create first version snapshot when ready for release
      
      This approach allows you to focus on content development before introducing the complexity of versioning.
    </ContentBlock>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
  
  <SectionLevelTwo id="ongoing-development" title="Ongoing Development">
    <ContentBlock>
      **Current/Next Version**:
      
      - All active development happens in the `docs/` directory
      - This represents the "next" or unreleased version
      - Changes here will be included in the next version snapshot
      
      **Released Versions**:
      
      - Stored in `versioned_docs/version-X.Y.Z/`
      - Only critical fixes should be made to released versions
      - Avoid adding new features to released versions
    </ContentBlock>
    
    <Admonition type="warning">
      Be cautious when modifying released versions. Changes should be limited to fixing errors or clarifying existing content, not adding new features.
    </Admonition>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
  
  <SectionLevelTwo id="version-lifecycle" title="Version Lifecycle">
    <ContentBlock>
      Define clear lifecycle stages for documentation versions:
      
      1. **Active** - Current version, fully supported
      2. **Maintained** - Previous versions still supported (typically last 1-2 major versions)
      3. **Legacy** - Older versions with limited support (security fixes only)
      4. **Archived** - No longer maintained, kept for historical reference
      
      Clearly communicate the lifecycle stage of each version to users.

</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="version-specific-content" title="Version-Specific Content">
  <SectionLevelTwo id="version-conditionals" title="Using Version Conditionals">
    <ContentBlock>
      Leverage version detection to display version-specific content. This allows you to show different information based on the version the user is viewing.
      
      For example, you might show:
      
      - "Coming soon" notices in the current/next version
      - Version-specific implementation details
      - Deprecated feature warnings in older versions
    </ContentBlock>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
  
  <SectionLevelTwo id="version-badges" title="Version Badges">
    <ContentBlock>
      Add version badges to indicate when features were introduced or deprecated. These visual indicators help users quickly understand feature availability across versions.
      
      Examples:
      
      - "Added in v1.2.0"
      - "Deprecated in v2.0.0"
      - "Changed in v1.5.0"
    </ContentBlock>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="migration-guides" title="Migration Guides">
  <SectionLevelTwo id="creating-guides" title="Creating Migration Guides">
    <ContentBlock>
      For each major version transition, create dedicated migration guides:
      
      - Place in `docs/migration/` directory
      - Include step-by-step instructions for upgrading
      - Highlight breaking changes and new features
      - Provide code examples showing before/after changes
      
      Migration guides are essential for helping users transition between versions smoothly.
    </ContentBlock>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
  
  <SectionLevelTwo id="version-banners" title="Version Banners">
    <ContentBlock>
      Use version banners to indicate deprecated or upcoming versions. These banners appear at the top of documentation pages and provide important context about the version status.
      
      Banner types:
      
      - **Unreleased** - For current/next version
      - **Unmaintained** - For legacy versions
      - **Warning** - For versions with known issues
    </ContentBlock>
  </SectionLevelTwo>
</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="version-pruning" title="Version Pruning Strategy">
  <ContentBlock>
    As the project evolves, implement a version pruning strategy:
    
    1. Maintain the last 2-3 major versions as fully documented
    2. For older versions, consider:
       - Removing from the version dropdown but keeping the files
       - Creating an "archive" section for legacy documentation
       - Consolidating multiple older versions into a single "legacy" version
    
    To remove a version:
    1. Remove it from the versions configuration
    2. Update version dropdown configuration
    3. Optionally delete the corresponding directories
    
    A good pruning strategy balances historical documentation access with maintainability.
  </ContentBlock>
  
  <Admonition type="note">
    Even when removing versions from the main navigation, consider keeping the files accessible via direct URLs for users who still need them.

<SectionLevelOne id="version-landing-page" title="Custom Version Landing Page">
  <ContentBlock>
    Create a custom versions landing page that:
    
    - Lists all available documentation versions
    - Clearly identifies the current/next version
    - Provides direct links to each version
    - Indicates the status of each version (active, maintained, legacy, archived)
    - Includes recommended upgrade paths
    
    This landing page serves as a central hub for users to find the appropriate documentation version.
  </ContentBlock>
</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="version-specific-sidebars" title="Version-Specific Sidebars">
  <ContentBlock>
    For complex documentation structures, you may need version-specific sidebars:
    
    - Each version can have its own navigation structure
    - New sections can be added to newer versions
    - Deprecated sections can be removed from newer versions
    - Sidebar organization can evolve over time
    
    Version-specific sidebars allow the documentation structure to evolve alongside the product.
  </ContentBlock>
</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="handling-assets" title="Handling Version-Specific Assets">
  <ContentBlock>
    For version-specific images, diagrams, and other assets:
    
    1. Create version-specific asset directories
    2. Reference assets with version-specific paths
    3. Update assets when creating new versions
    
    This approach ensures that each version displays the correct visual assets.
  </ContentBlock>
</SectionLevelOne>

<SectionLevelOne id="versioning-automation" title="Versioning Automation">
  <ContentBlock>
    Consider implementing automation to streamline versioning:
    
    1. **Pre-version Checks**: Verify documentation quality before creating a version
    2. **Post-version Updates**: Automatically update references and links
    3. **Version Announcement**: Generate release notes and announcements
    4. **Broken Link Detection**: Verify all links work across versions
    
    Automation reduces the manual effort required to maintain versioned documentation.
