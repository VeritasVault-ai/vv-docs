> Strategies and Procedures for Managing VeritasVault Protocol Treasury Assets

---

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed management procedures, investment strategies, and risk frameworks used to govern the VeritasVault Protocol treasury assets. It defines the principles, methodologies, and operational processes to optimize treasury performance while maintaining appropriate risk controls.

## Treasury Management Principles

### 1. Capital Preservation

* Prioritization of principal safety over yield
* Risk-appropriate diversification across assets and custodians
* Regular risk assessment of all treasury positions
* Comprehensive insurance and security measures
* Conservative valuation of illiquid assets

### 2. Strategic Liquidity

* Tiered liquidity structure to match different treasury needs
* Minimum liquidity thresholds for each treasury pool
* Scheduled liquidity planning for anticipated needs
* Stress testing for emergency liquidity scenarios
* Diversified liquidity sources and exit strategies

### 3. Yield Optimization

* Risk-calibrated yield strategies for different treasury segments
* Regular benchmarking against industry standards
* Continuous evaluation of emerging yield opportunities
* Yield farming only with thoroughly audited protocols
* Clear yield attribution and performance tracking

### 4. Transparent Operations

* Full on-chain visibility of treasury transactions
* Regular reporting on investment strategies and results
* Clear documentation of all management decisions
* Independent verification of treasury balances
* Open performance metrics and comparison to targets

## Asset Allocation Framework

### Risk Categorization

Treasury assets are categorized into risk tiers that determine their allocation limits and management strategies:

#### Tier 1: Core Reserve Assets (Low Risk)

* **Assets**: Stablecoins (USDC, DAI), ETH, BTC
* **Allocation Range**: 40-60% of treasury
* **Purpose**: Capital preservation, base liquidity
* **Management**: Direct custody, minimal counterparty exposure
* **Expected Return**: 1-5% APY

#### Tier 2: Enhanced Yield Assets (Medium Risk)

* **Assets**: Diversified DeFi lending, liquid staking, blue-chip LP positions
* **Allocation Range**: 20-40% of treasury
* **Purpose**: Sustainable yield generation
* **Management**: Distributed across top protocols with caps per position
* **Expected Return**: 5-15% APY

#### Tier 3: Strategic Assets (Higher Risk)

* **Assets**: Protocol ecosystem investments, strategic token positions
* **Allocation Range**: 10-25% of treasury
* **Purpose**: Ecosystem alignment, strategic partnerships, growth
* **Management**: Individual position analysis, regular review
* **Expected Return**: Variable, potentially >15% APY

#### Tier 4: Speculative Investments (High Risk)

* **Assets**: Early-stage projects, new DeFi mechanisms
* **Allocation Range**: 0-10% of treasury
* **Purpose**: High growth potential, innovation exposure
* **Management**: Rigorous due diligence, small position sizes
* **Expected Return**: High variability with asymmetric return profile

### Rebalancing Process

* **Regular Review**: Monthly assessment of asset allocation
* **Rebalancing Triggers**: 
  * Deviation of >5% from target allocation
  * Significant market events
  * Changes in protocol funding needs
  * Risk profile changes in specific assets
* **Execution**: Gradual rebalancing to minimize market impact
* **Approval Process**: Treasury Committee approval for major reallocations

  * Maximum exposure per protocol
  * Counterparty exposure limits
  * Chain/ecosystem diversification requirements

* **Market Monitoring**:

  * Liquidity depth monitoring for key assets
  * Trend analysis and macro environment assessment

### Operational Risk Controls

* **Security Measures**:
