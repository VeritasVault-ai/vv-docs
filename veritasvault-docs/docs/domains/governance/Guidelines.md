VeritasVault Artifact 5 – Governance, Ops & Custody Domain
Guidelines, Best Practices & Pitfalls
1. Overview
This document distills actionable guidelines, architectural best practices, critical success factors, and known pitfalls for building, securing, and operating the Governance, Ops & Custody domain in VeritasVault. Treat this as a living companion to the Architecture Guide—mandatory reading for all reviews, audits, and sign-offs.

2. Governance Best Practices
On-Chain Governance
Everything On-Chain: All proposals, votes, parameter changes, upgrades, and custody actions must be executed, signed, and logged on-chain—no exceptions.

No Off-Chain Shortcuts: Avoid off-chain voting, ambiguous delegation, or opaque control. Only on-chain, replayable actions are valid.

Time-Locks & Quorums: All high-impact actions require enforceable time-locks and quorum verification.

Multi-Sig For Critical Ops: Upgrades, fund movements, and emergency interventions require multi-signature approval, with signers explicitly defined by action type.

Emergency Controls: Emergency overrides/rollbacks must be auditable, rate-limited, and thoroughly tested.

Parameter Versioning: Version every protocol parameter; provide full changelogs directly accessible from the chain.

Proposal & Voting Integrity
Standardized Templates: All proposals should follow a standard format (actions, rationale, dependencies).

Delegation Transparency: Maintain a fully on-chain, opt-in/opt-out delegation registry.

Dispute Windows: Always include challenge/appeal periods for all actions with systemic impact.

Post-Mortems: Publish public post-mortems for every failed, disputed, or emergency action.

3. Security & Auditability
Event Flow & Audit Chains
Event-Sourcing: Every critical operation emits an event and extends the event/audit chain.

Immutable Logs: Audit records are append-only, tamper-proof, and cryptographically signed.

Proof Linking: Every event should reference a proof chain or hash of the previous state.

Cross-Chain Proofs: All cross-chain operations require proof-of-execution and bidirectional traceability.

Audit-First: No major upgrade or treasury move goes live without passing all audit/replay checks.

Custody & Escrow
Time-Locks & Multi-Sig: Asset releases require both; never allow single-signer or premature unlocks.

Disaster Recovery: Routinely test custody backup/restore and document asset recovery processes.

Escrow Transparency: All custody events and swaps must be logged and revertible.

Emergency Unlocks: Emergency releases must be multi-sig, rate-limited, and logged.

4. Treasury & Fund Management
Portfolio Strategies: Treasury investments must use versioned, reviewable, and risk-scored strategies.

Spend Controls: Every outflow (grants, claims, payouts) requires a voted proposal.

Claim Validation: Insurance payouts must be linked to verifiable proofs and the audit/event chain.

Auto-Rebalancing: Allow only with proven rollback controls and event logging.

Fee & Risk Monitoring: Continuously track treasury exposure, fees, slippage, and raise alerts on anomalies.

5. Upgrade & Rollback Patterns
Gradual Rollouts: Use feature flags, canary deployments, and staged rollouts for critical changes.

Automated Rollback: All upgrades must have an auditable, automated rollback path.

Migration Testing: Dry-run all state/user/parameter migrations on testnets before mainnet deployment.

A/B Testing: Allow A/B or feature flagging for non-critical changes, always with logging and rollback.

6. Cross-Chain, Automation, and Advanced Ops
Cross-Chain Governance: All cross-chain actions must use bi-directional proofs, state sync, and verifiable execution logs.

Task Automation: Every scheduled or automated job is deterministic, logged, and revertible.

Dispute/Arbitration: Ensure rapid, transparent dispute handling and document every resolution.

Metrics & Monitoring: Track proposal effectiveness, voting rates, upgrade reliability, system health, and incident response.

Capacity Planning: Forecast resource and audit needs for governance, treasury, and scaling events.

7. Common Pitfalls
Silent Changes: Upgrades or parameter changes without on-chain proposals, votes, and audit trails.

Opaque Delegation: Untracked or off-chain delegation—never allow.

Orphaned Escrow: Stale locks or swaps left unresolved; always implement timeouts and monitoring.

Unlogged Rollbacks: Rollbacks without an event/audit chain—never allow.

Untested DR: Disaster recovery or backup flows that are never tested in prod-like scenarios.

Regulatory Misses: Failure to log or escalate compliance-relevant actions.

Metrics Blindness: Only tracking successes/failures, not full workflow, latency, or incident detail.

8. Critical Success Factors
Auditability: Every decision, change, and asset flow is cryptographically signed and auditable.

Security: Multi-sig, time-locks, and circuit breakers enforced everywhere.

Operational Resilience: DR, incident playbooks, and rollback drills tested quarterly.

Dispute Effectiveness: Transparent, prompt, and traceable challenge/appeal flows.

Metrics-Driven: Governance and fund ops are tracked, measured, and alert-enabled.

Bottom Line: Protocol governance is the top attack vector. Build for scrutiny, prove every action, and make sure every failure path is as visible—and auditable—as every success. If you can’t trust or reverse it, neither can anyone else.
