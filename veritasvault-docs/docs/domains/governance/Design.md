## Technical Impact

* DAO proposal, voting, parameterization, delegation, and dispute/arbitration frameworks.
* Automated upgrade, migration, and rollback—plus cross-chain proposal execution and monitoring.
* Advanced treasury management, event flow tracing, and enhanced audit/logging for institutional controls.
* Integrated custody, escrow, insurance, and operational playbooks for critical event handling.
* Model parameter governance, approval workflows, and audit trails for financial models.

## Timeline Impact

* **Phase 1:** GovernanceController, Proposal & Vote mechanics, ParameterStore, event flow and enhanced audit logging.
* **Phase 2:** UpgradeController, scheduled tasks, dispute management, and A/B feature rollout.
* **Phase 3:** Treasury, InsuranceFund, EscrowController, and advanced cross-chain governance.
* **Phase 4:** Full automation, capacity planning, advanced recovery/rollback, and regulatory triggers.
* **Phase 5:** Financial model governance, parameter approval workflows, and portfolio constraint management.

# 3. Domain Overview

The Governance, Ops & Custody domain is the backbone of protocol integrity, upgradeability, treasury, and custodial operations in VeritasVault. It covers the entire lifecycle for governance, voting, upgrades, fund flows, insurance, and on-chain dispute management, with a focus on auditability, security, and cross-chain execution.

---

# 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

## Core Functions

* DAO proposal/voting lifecycle (incl. cross-chain/multi-chain governance)
* Parameter management and on-chain configuration/versioning
* Secure contract upgrade, rollback, and state migration
* Treasury, portfolio, and insurance management with advanced strategies
* Task scheduling, automation, and A/B/feature flag rollout
* Dispute, slashing, and arbitration (with proof/event flow tracking)
* Multi-sig, time-locked, and escrow custody operations
* System health/metrics monitoring and incident recovery
* Financial model parameter governance and approval workflows
* Model output verification and audit trails

## Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * GovernanceController, ProposalRepository, ParameterStore, UpgradeController, EventFlow, Treasury, InsuranceFund, TaskScheduler, DisputeManager, EscrowController, CrossChainGovernance, AuditEnhanced, ModelGovernance, ParameterApproval
* **Out of Scope:**

  * Application-layer UIs, third-party custody services, fiat on/off-ramp logic

---

# 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

## Aggregate Roots

* **Proposal:** Proposals (on-chain/cross-chain), lifecycle, parameter/upgrade/change actions.
* **Vote:** Voting/delegation, outcomes, quorum.
* **Upgrade:** Upgrades, rollback/version, migration state.
* **TreasuryAsset:** Treasury/insurance, grant tracking, fund status, advanced strategies.
* **Dispute:** Arbitration, fraud proof, event chains.
* **EscrowLock:** Multi-sig, time-locked, and cross-chain custody.
* **EventChain:** Proof/event chain, traceability for all critical events.
* **ModelParameter:** Financial model parameters, version history, approvals.
* **PortfolioConstraint:** Portfolio allocation constraints and validation rules.

## Entities

* **Parameter:** Versioned on-chain parameters/history.
* **InsuranceClaim:** Claim, proof, dispute linkage.
* **ScheduledTask:** Automation jobs and feature rollout events.
* **ParameterApproval:** Approval workflow for model parameters.
* **ModelOutput:** Verified outputs from financial models.

## Value Objects

* **ProposalStatus:** Enum for lifecycle.
* **ParameterKey:** Key for parameter management.
* **DisputeStatus:** Enum for dispute outcomes.
* **EscrowCondition:** Custody criteria (immutable).
* **PortfolioStrategy:** Treasury investment/risk.
* **ModelConfidence:** Confidence level for model parameters.
* **ConstraintType:** Type of portfolio constraint.

## Domain Events

* **ProposalCreated, VoteCast, ParameterUpdated, UpgradeExecuted, TreasuryFunded, ClaimProcessed, TaskScheduled, DisputeResolved, EscrowReleased, EventChained, CrossChainActionExecuted, AuditRecordLogged, ModelParameterApproved, ModelOutputVerified, ConstraintValidated**

## Repository Contracts

* **IProposalRepository, IParameterRepository, IUpgradeRepository, ITreasuryRepository, IDisputeRepository, IEscrowRepository, IEventFlowRepository, ICrossChainGovernance, IAuditEnhanced, IModelParameterRepository, IPortfolioConstraintRepository**

## Invariants / Business Rules

* No upgrade or parameter change without proposal and voting (with quorum, time-lock, and audit).
* Cross-chain proposals must be validated and tracked across chains.
* Treasury actions require strategy validation and risk checks.
* All event flows, disputes, and custody must be event-sourced, signed, and verifiable.
* A/B testing/feature rollout must be reversible with audit logs and automated rollback.
* Financial model parameters must go through approval workflow before production use.
* Portfolio allocations must satisfy all defined constraints.

# 6. Extended Interface & Architecture Patterns

        bytes32 action;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bytes32[] proofChain;
    }
    function logAuditRecord(AuditRecord memory record) external;
    function validateAuditChain(bytes32 recordId) external view returns (bool);
