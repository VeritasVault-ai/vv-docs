# Custody Protocol

> Comprehensive System for Secure Digital Asset Custody in the VeritasVault Protocol

---

## Introduction

The VeritasVault Custody Protocol defines the comprehensive system for securing, managing, and operating the custody of digital assets within the protocol. This document provides a thorough overview of the custody architecture, operational procedures, security measures, and governance framework that together form the foundation of the protocol's asset custody approach.

## Custody System Architecture

### Core Custody Model

The VeritasVault Protocol implements a hybrid custody model that combines the security benefits of decentralized custody with the operational efficiency of structured governance. This model is built on the following pillars:

#### Layered Security Architecture

* **Cryptographic Foundation**:
  * Advanced multi-signature technology
  * Threshold signature schemes
  * Hierarchical deterministic key derivation
  * Zero-knowledge proof validation
  * Hardware security integration

* **Protocol-Level Controls**:
  * Smart contract security layers
  * On-chain validation mechanisms
  * Time-locked execution
  * Transaction approval workflows
  * Circuit breaker capabilities

* **Operational Security**:
  * Segregated operational environments
  * Defense-in-depth approach
  * Principle of least privilege
  * Continuous monitoring and alerting
  * Comprehensive audit logging

#### Custody Tiering System

The custody system is organized into tiers based on security requirements, accessibility needs, and asset value:

| Tier | Purpose | Security Model | Access Pattern | Key Features |
|------|---------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Tier 1: Cold Storage | Long-term reserves | Multi-sig (7-of-10) with air-gapped devices | Infrequent, governance-approved access | Geographically distributed keys, maximum security |
| Tier 2: Warm Storage | Medium-term holdings | Multi-sig (5-of-8) with HSMs | Scheduled access, limited emergency use | Balance of security and accessibility |
| Tier 3: Hot Wallets | Daily operations | Multi-sig (3-of-5) with threshold controls | Regular authorized access | Operational efficiency with strong security |
| Tier 4: Smart Contract Vaults | Automated protocol operations | Formally verified contracts with time-locks | Programmatic rule-based access | Maximum automation with appropriate safeguards |
