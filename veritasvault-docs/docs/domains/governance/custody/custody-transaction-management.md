# Custody Transaction Management

> Procedures for Secure Transaction Handling in the VeritasVault Protocol

---

## Overview

This document details the transaction management procedures within the VeritasVault custody system. It outlines the processes, controls, and workflows for initiating, approving, executing, and monitoring transactions involving protocol-managed assets across different custody tiers.

## Transaction Types

### Protocol Operations

* **Collateral Management**:
  * Collateral deposits from users
  * Collateral withdrawal processing
  * Collateral rebalancing between tiers
  * Collateral type migration
  * Emergency collateral protection actions

* **Treasury Operations**:
  * Strategic asset allocation transactions
  * Yield generation deployments
  * Operational expense funding
  * Grant disbursements
  * Reserve rebalancing

* **Protocol Governance**:
  * Governance proposal execution
  * Parameter updates
  * Protocol upgrade deployment
  * Emergency response actions
  * Cross-chain governance operations

### Administrative Operations

* **Key Management**:
  * Key rotation transactions
  * Signer addition/removal
  * Threshold adjustments
  * Access control updates
  * Recovery address management

* **Smart Contract Management**:
  * Contract deployment
  * Contract upgrades
  * Contract parameter updates
  * Emergency pause/unpause
  * Integration contract approvals

## Transaction Workflow

### Transaction Initiation

1. **Request Submission**
   * Standardized transaction request format
   * Required transaction metadata:
     * Purpose and justification
     * Asset type and amount
     * Source and destination
     * Required approval level
     * Execution timeframe
   * Supporting documentation requirements
   * Risk assessment for significant transactions

2. **Preliminary Validation**
   * Transaction syntax verification
   * Destination address validation
   * Asset availability confirmation
   * Policy compliance check
   * Fee estimation and approval

3. **Classification and Routing**
   * Transaction risk level determination
   * Required approval path identification
   * Quorum requirements calculation
   * Time-sensitivity assessment
   * Special handling flag identification

### Approval Process

1. **Standard Transactions**
   * Tiered approval based on transaction value:
     * Tier 1 (< $10,000): Operations team approval
     * Tier 2 ($10,000-$100,000): Operations + Technical lead approval
     * Tier 3 ($100,000-$1M): Technical Committee approval
     * Tier 4 (> $1M): Protocol Council approval
   * Approval routing based on classification
   * Required documentation verification
   * Out-of-band confirmation for high-value transactions
   * Escalation path for urgent transactions

2. **Governance-Driven Transactions**
   * Verification of governance approval
   * Proposal hash verification
   * Vote threshold confirmation
   * Time-lock compliance verification
   * Governance authorization documentation

3. **Automated Transactions**
   * Parameter-based authorization
   * Smart contract-governed limits
   * Anomaly detection checks
   * Circuit breaker verification
   * Audit log generation

### Transaction Preparation

1. **Transaction Construction**
   * Standardized transaction templates
   * Gas optimization for blockchain transactions
   * Nonce management and coordination
   * Transaction batching where appropriate
   * Transaction simulation before signing

2. **Security Verification**
   * Multi-level validation of transaction details
   * Destination address verification (whitelisting)
   * Amount verification against limits
   * Transaction purpose verification
   * Final policy compliance check

3. **Signing Preparation**
   * Signing package preparation
   * Distribution to authorized signers
   * Signing deadline establishment
   * Quorum tracking
   * Signing instructions documentation

### Transaction Execution

1. **Signature Collection**
   * Secure distribution of transaction data
   * Independent verification by each signer
   * Out-of-band confirmation for critical transactions
   * Signature collection and validation
   * Quorum verification before submission

2. **Transaction Broadcast**
   * Network condition assessment
   * Optimal gas price determination
   * Transaction submission
   * Confirmation monitoring
   * Resubmission protocol for stuck transactions

3. **Execution Verification**
   * Transaction receipt verification
   * Execution outcome validation
   * State change verification
   * Post-transaction balance reconciliation
   * Notification to stakeholders

## Transaction Security Controls

### Prevention Controls

* **Policy Enforcement**:
  * Transaction limits by tier and type
  * Restricted address whitelisting
  * Cooling periods for new destinations
  * Time-of-day restrictions for high-value transactions
  * Velocity checks and rate limiting

* **Validation Rules**:
  * Multi-level validation checks
  * Syntax and semantic verification
  * Abnormal pattern detection
  * Blacklist screening
  * Gas limit validation

* **Address Security**:
  * Address ownership verification protocols
  * Test transaction requirements for new addresses
  * Address format validation
  * ENS/domain verification for named addresses
  * Address purpose tagging and categorization

### Detection Controls

* **Real-time Monitoring**:
  * Transaction submission monitoring
  * Mempool observation for transactions
  * Confirmation tracking
  * Value flow monitoring
  * Anomaly detection for transaction patterns

* **Reconciliation**:
  * Pre/post transaction balance verification
  * Expected vs. actual outcome comparison
  * Transaction fee monitoring
  * Cross-system reconciliation
  * Regular reserve validation

* **Alerting Framework**:
  * Threshold-based alerts
  * Transaction failure notifications
  * Unusual pattern alerts
  * Approval timeout warnings
  * Security anomaly escalation

### Response Controls

* **Transaction Interventions**:
  * Transaction acceleration procedures
  * Transaction cancellation protocols
  * Replacement transaction procedures
  * Front-running prevention measures
  * MEV protection strategies

* **Incident Management**:
  * Unexpected outcome response procedures
  * Transaction investigation framework
  * Recovery option assessment
  * Stakeholder communication templates
  * Escalation procedures

## Special Transaction Types

### Multi-Chain Operations

* **Cross-Chain Transfers**:
  * Bridge security assessment
  * Enhanced verification for cross-chain destinations
  * Liquidity verification before large transfers
  * Fragmented transfers for large amounts
  * Confirmation requirements by destination chain

* **Chain-Specific Controls**:
  * Chain-specific transaction construction
