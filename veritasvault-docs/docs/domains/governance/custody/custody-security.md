# Custody Security Measures

> Comprehensive Security Framework for VeritasVault Protocol Asset Protection

---

## Overview

This document details the security measures implemented by the VeritasVault Protocol to protect digital assets under custody. It outlines the technical, operational, and procedural safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access, detect potential threats, and respond effectively to security incidents.

## Key Management Security

### Key Generation

* **Air-Gapped Generation**:
  * Keys generated on dedicated hardware devices with no network connectivity
  * Entropy sourced from multiple high-quality random sources
  * Physical security during the entire generation ceremony
  * Witnessed and documented generation procedures
  * Independent verification of process integrity

* **Hierarchical Deterministic Framework**:
  * BIP32/BIP39 compliant key derivation
  * Segregated derivation paths by asset type and purpose
  * Limited key depth to reduce attack surface
  * Regular key tree structure audits
  * Formal verification of derivation implementations

* **Distributed Generation**:
  * Threshold-based key generation (Shamir's Secret Sharing)
  * Geographic distribution of generation ceremonies
  * Multi-party computation for sensitive keys
  * No single party possesses complete key material
  * Independent trustless verification of shares

### Key Storage

* **Hardware Security**:
  * EAL6+ certified hardware security modules for warm storage
  * Air-gapped hardware wallets for cold storage
  * Custom-secured signing devices with limited functionality
  * Tamper-evident packaging and seals
  * Regular physical inspection protocols

* **Physical Security**:
  * Bank-grade vaults for cold storage devices
  * Geographically distributed secure facilities
  * Multi-layer physical access controls
  * 24/7 surveillance and monitoring
  * Environmental controls and protection

* **Backup Security**:
  * Encrypted and distributed key backups
  * Multiple recovery mechanisms
  * Regular backup verification process
  * Separation of backup access from operational access
  * Jurisdictional distribution of backup materials

### Key Usage

* **Multi-Signature Implementation**:
  * N-of-M signature requirements scaled by value
  * Minimum 3-of-5 for any significant value
  * Higher thresholds (5-of-7, 7-of-10) for major reserves
  * No single-signature operations for protocol assets
  * Regular review of threshold appropriateness

* **Transaction Signing Workflow**:
  * Segregation of transaction creation and signing
  * Multi-level verification before signing
  * Mandatory out-of-band confirmation
  * Transaction purpose documentation
  * Automated policy enforcement

* **Key Rotation**:
  * Regular scheduled key rotation
  * Immediate rotation upon security events
  * Phased rotation to maintain operational continuity
  * Independent verification of new keys
  * Secure decommissioning of retired keys

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security

* **Segmentation**:
  * Air-gapped environments for cold storage
  * Network isolation for signing infrastructure
  * Dedicated secure networks for custody operations
  * Micro-segmentation of custody components
  * Defense-in-depth network architecture

* **Access Control**:
  * Zero-trust architecture
  * Just-in-time privileged access
  * Multi-factor authentication for all access
  * Role-based access control
  * Continuous verification of access patterns

* **Monitoring and Defense**:
  * 24/7 security operations monitoring
  * Intrusion detection and prevention systems
  * Behavioral analytics for anomaly detection
  * DDoS protection and mitigation
  * Regular penetration testing

### System Security

* **Hardened Infrastructure**:
  * Minimal operating systems with unnecessary components removed
  * Regular security patching and updates
  * Immutable infrastructure approach
  * Configuration management and drift detection
  * Security benchmarks and compliance

* **Endpoint Protection**:
  * Advanced endpoint security on all systems
  * Application whitelisting
  * Full disk encryption
  * Secure boot mechanisms
  * Device attestation and verification

* **Data Protection**:
  * End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
  * Secure data lifecycle management
  * Data leakage prevention
  * Secure data destruction procedures
  * Regular data protection audits

## Smart Contract Security

### Code Security

* **Development Practices**:
  * Formal security requirements definition
  * Secure development lifecycle
  * Pair programming for critical components
  * Comprehensive test coverage
  * Code quality metrics and enforcement

* **Verification**:
  * Formal verification of critical contracts
  * Multiple independent security audits
  * Automated static analysis
  * Symbolic execution testing
  * Property-based testing

* **Deployment Security**:
  * Multi-stage deployment process
  * Testnet validation before mainnet deployment
  * Bytecode verification before interaction
  * Deployment address verification
  * Post-deployment validation testing

### Contract Safeguards

* **Access Controls**:
  * Role-based access control framework
  * Time-locked administrative functions
  * Multi-signature requirements for critical functions
  * Granular permission design
  * Regular access review

* **Circuit Breakers**:
  * Emergency pause functionality
  * Graduated response mechanisms
  * Automatic circuit breakers for anomalous activity
  * Manual override with multi-sig approval
  * Regular testing of emergency functions

* **Upgrade Path**:
  * Secure proxy pattern implementation
  * Time-locked upgrades
  * Governance-approved implementations
  * State migration verification
  * Comprehensive upgrade testing
