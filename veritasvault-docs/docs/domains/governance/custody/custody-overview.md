# Custody Protocol Overview

> Core Framework for Secure Asset Custody in the VeritasVault Protocol

---

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the VeritasVault custody protocol, which defines the systems, policies, and procedures governing the secure custody of digital assets within the protocol. The custody model balances security, accessibility, and decentralization to ensure assets remain protected while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Custody Philosophy

The VeritasVault custody protocol operates on four foundational principles:

### 1. Defense in Depth

* Multiple layers of security for all custody operations
* Redundant protection mechanisms with no single points of failure
* Separation of operational and storage environments
* Tiered access controls based on sensitivity
* Regular security assessment and enhancement

### 2. Transparent Verification

* On-chain verification of custodied assets
* Public attestation of reserves
* Auditable custody operations
* Clear chain of custody documentation
* Independent verification mechanisms

### 3. Controlled Decentralization

* Progressive decentralization of custody authority
* Multi-party security models
* Distributed key management
* Governance-based authorization for critical operations
* Balance between security and operational efficiency

### 4. Resilient Recovery

* Comprehensive disaster recovery planning
* Multiple recovery paths for various failure scenarios
* Regular recovery testing and simulation
* Geographic and jurisdictional distribution
* Succession planning for key management

## Custody Architecture

### Custody Tiers

The protocol implements a tiered custody architecture that applies different security models based on asset value, liquidity requirements, and operational needs:

#### Tier 1: Cold Storage

* **Purpose**: Long-term storage of high-value protocol reserves
* **Security Model**: Multi-signature with air-gapped signing devices
* **Access Pattern**: Infrequent, planned withdrawals with governance approval
* **Key Management**: Distributed across multiple security domains and jurisdictions
* **Verification**: Regular attestations and on-chain proof of reserves

#### Tier 2: Warm Storage

* **Purpose**: Medium-term storage with moderate accessibility requirements
* **Security Model**: Multi-signature with hardware security modules
* **Access Pattern**: Regular scheduled operations, limited emergency access
* **Key Management**: Distributed but more accessible than cold storage
* **Verification**: Automated monitoring and frequent attestation

#### Tier 3: Hot Wallets

* **Purpose**: Daily operations requiring high availability
* **Security Model**: Multi-signature with threshold controls
* **Access Pattern**: Frequent automated and manual transactions
* **Key Management**: Distributed with automated failover capabilities
* **Verification**: Real-time monitoring and daily reconciliation

#### Tier 4: Smart Contract Vaults

* **Purpose**: Automated protocol operations with programmatic rules
* **Security Model**: Formally verified smart contracts with time-locks
* **Access Pattern**: Continuous programmable access following protocol rules
* **Key Management**: Governance-controlled parameters and circuit breakers
* **Verification**: On-chain transparency with continuous monitoring

## Custody Roles and Responsibilities

### Key Custodians

* **Role**: Safeguard private key components for multi-signature operations
* **Selection**: Combination of technical expertise and community trust
* **Responsibilities**: Secure key management, timely transaction signing, participation in key rotation
* **Authority**: Partial signing authority according to multi-sig policies
* **Oversight**: Regular performance review by the Protocol Council

### Custody Operations Team

* **Role**: Day-to-day management of custody operations
* **Selection**: Professional experience in digital asset custody
* **Responsibilities**: Transaction preparation, verification, monitoring, reporting
* **Authority**: Transaction initiation, automated transaction approval within limits
* **Oversight**: Treasury Committee and Technical Committee

### Custody Technical Committee

* **Role**: Technical oversight of custody infrastructure
* **Selection**: Technical expertise in cryptographic systems and security
* **Responsibilities**: Custody system design, security review, enhancement planning
* **Authority**: Custody infrastructure upgrades, security policy definition
* **Oversight**: Protocol Council and Technical Committee

### Protocol Council

* **Role**: High-level oversight and policy approval
* **Selection**: Elected governance representatives
* **Responsibilities**: Custody policy approval, custodian approval, exception handling
* **Authority**: Major custody policy changes, high-value transaction approval
* **Oversight**: Token holder governance

## Integration Points

### Treasury Management

* The custody protocol directly supports treasury management operations
* Tiered custody aligns with treasury asset categorization
* Custody operations implement treasury management directives
* Regular coordination between custody and treasury teams

### Governance System

* Custody operations governed by protocol governance mechanisms
* Key threshold changes require governance approval
* Custodian selection overseen by governance processes
* Major custody policy changes subject to governance votes

### Protocol Operations

* Custody system supports core protocol functionality
* Smart contract vaults enable automated protocol operations
* Liquidity provision through controlled hot wallet access
* Transaction signing integrated with protocol operations
