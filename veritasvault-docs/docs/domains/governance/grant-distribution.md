# Grant Distribution

> Framework for Allocating VeritasVault Protocol Resources to Ecosystem Development

---

## Overview

This document outlines the structured approach for distributing grants from the VeritasVault Protocol treasury to support ecosystem growth, innovation, and community development. The grant program is designed to strategically allocate resources to initiatives that enhance the protocol's functionality, adoption, and long-term sustainability.

## Grant Program Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Ecosystem Expansion**: Fund projects that extend the utility and reach of the VeritasVault Protocol
2. **Technical Innovation**: Support research and development of new features and improvements
3. **Community Growth**: Foster a vibrant and engaged community of users and contributors
4. **Security Enhancement**: Improve the overall security posture of the protocol and ecosystem
5. **Adoption Acceleration**: Reduce barriers to integration and usage of the protocol

### Strategic Alignment

All grants must demonstrate clear alignment with at least one of the following strategic priorities:

* **Protocol Development**: Core functionality enhancement, performance optimization, or scalability improvements
* **Integration & Tooling**: Development of tools, APIs, SDKs, or integrations that expand protocol utility
* **Education & Adoption**: Creation of educational content, onboarding resources, or adoption initiatives
* **Community Building**: Events, governance participation, or community infrastructure
* **Security & Resilience**: Audits, bug bounties, formal verification, or security tooling

## Grant Categories

### Builder Grants

* **Purpose**: Support development of applications, tools, or infrastructure that utilize VeritasVault Protocol
* **Size Range**: $5,000 - $100,000 USD equivalent
* **Duration**: 1-6 months
* **Target Recipients**: Development teams, startups, DAOs building on VeritasVault
* **Key Requirements**: Working prototype or clear technical specification, alignment with protocol goals
* **Success Metrics**: Functional deliverable, user adoption, code quality

### Research Grants

* **Purpose**: Fund technical research, economic analysis, or security investigations
* **Size Range**: $10,000 - $75,000 USD equivalent
* **Duration**: 2-9 months
* **Target Recipients**: Academic researchers, independent security researchers, economic analysts
* **Key Requirements**: Clear research methodology, qualified researchers, publication commitment
* **Success Metrics**: Published findings, peer review, practical applications of research

### Community Grants

* **Purpose**: Support community-led initiatives, educational content, and localization efforts
* **Size Range**: $1,000 - $25,000 USD equivalent
* **Duration**: 1-3 months
* **Target Recipients**: Community members, content creators, local ambassadors
* **Key Requirements**: Community impact plan, realistic deliverables, engagement strategy
* **Success Metrics**: Community growth, content quality, engagement metrics

### Strategic Partnerships

* **Purpose**: Form deep integrations with complementary protocols and ecosystem players
* **Size Range**: $50,000 - $500,000 USD equivalent
* **Duration**: 6-24 months
* **Target Recipients**: Established projects, protocols with significant user bases
* **Key Requirements**: Clear integration plan, mutual value creation, co-development commitment
* **Success Metrics**: Integration completion, user adoption, volume of interactions

### Retroactive Funding

* **Purpose**: Reward valuable contributions made without prior agreement
* **Size Range**: Variable based on impact assessment
* **Eligibility**: Projects already completed that demonstrate significant value to the ecosystem
* **Key Requirements**: Evidence of impact, community validation, open-source availability
* **Success Metrics**: Demonstrated value already created for the protocol ecosystem

## Governance Process

### Grant Committee

* **Composition**: Treasury Committee members, technical advisors, community representatives
* **Term**: 6-month terms with staggered rotation
* **Selection**: Technical members appointed by Technical Committee, community representatives elected
* **Authority**: Approval of grants within defined parameters, recommendation of larger grants to DAO vote
* **Meetings**: Bi-weekly review sessions with public minutes

### Application Process

1. **Initial Submission**
   * Standardized application form
   * Project description and alignment with strategic goals
   * Team background and qualifications
   * Detailed budget and milestone schedule
   * Expected impact and success metrics

2. **Community Review**
   * Public posting of grant proposals
   * Community discussion period (7-14 days)
   * Feedback collection and proposal refinement
   * Social signaling of community support

3. **Committee Evaluation**
   * Technical feasibility assessment
   * Budget appropriateness review
   * Strategic alignment verification
   * Team capability evaluation
   * Risk assessment

4. **Decision Process**
   * Committee voting on proposals
   * Graduated approval thresholds based on grant size
   * Full DAO vote for grants above committee authority limit
   * Transparent recording of decisions and rationale

### Milestone-Based Funding

* **Structure**:
  * Initial funding upon approval (15-25%)
  * Milestone-based disbursements
  * Final payment upon project completion (15-25%)

* **Milestone Verification**:
  * Deliverable submission
  * Technical review of code or outputs
  * Progress reporting
  * Community demonstration where applicable

* **Adjustment Mechanisms**:
  * Mid-project scope modifications if needed
  * Timeline extensions with justification
  * Budget adjustments based on changing conditions
  * Project cancellation process for unsuccessful grants

## Reporting and Accountability

### Grantee Responsibilities

* **Regular Updates**:
  * Bi-weekly progress reports for active grants
  * Public development logs where appropriate
  * Participation in community calls
  * Milestone completion notifications

* **Deliverable Management**:
  * Code repository access
  * Documentation requirements
  * Open-source licensing compliance
  * Quality standards adherence

* **Post-Grant Requirements**:
  * Implementation support period
  * Knowledge transfer sessions
  * Maintenance commitment where applicable
  * Impact assessment participation

### Transparency Measures

* **Public Records**:
  * All approved grants listed publicly
  * Funding amounts and schedules disclosed
  * Milestone completion status tracking
  * Final deliverables linked publicly

* **Performance Tracking**:
  * Dashboard of active grants and statuses
  * Funds allocated vs. milestone achievement
