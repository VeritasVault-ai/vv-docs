# Tail Risk Management

> Methods for measuring and managing low-probability, high-impact events

---

## Overview

Tail risk refers to the risk of extreme, rare events that occur in the "tails" of a probability distribution. These events, while uncommon, can have outsized impacts on portfolio performance. This section covers specialized methodologies for measuring, analyzing, and managing tail risk in investment portfolios.

## Key Tail Risk Measures

This section covers various approaches to measuring and managing tail risk:

* **[Tail Risk Overview](./tail-risk-overview.md)**: Introduction to tail risk concepts and challenges
* **[Value-at-Risk (VaR)](./value-at-risk.md)**: Estimating potential loss at specific confidence levels
* **[Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)](./conditional-value-at-risk.md)**: Expected loss beyond VaR threshold
* **[Extreme Value Theory](./extreme-value-theory.md)**: Statistical methods for modeling extreme events

## Key Concepts

* **Distributional Properties**: Understanding non-normal return distributions
* **Confidence Levels**: Selection of appropriate probability thresholds
* **Estimation Methods**: Different approaches to estimating tail risk
* **Risk Integration**: Incorporating tail risk in overall risk frameworks
* **Hedging Strategies**: Approaches to mitigate tail risk exposure

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing tail risk measurement, consider:

* **Data Requirements**: Historical data needs for reliable estimation
* **Model Risk**: Potential for errors in underlying assumptions
* **Statistical Challenges**: Difficulties in estimating rare events
* **Parameter Selection**: Impact of parameter choices on risk estimates
* **Integration**: How tail risk measures complement other risk metrics

For implementation details on specific tail risk methodologies, refer to the individual documentation pages.
