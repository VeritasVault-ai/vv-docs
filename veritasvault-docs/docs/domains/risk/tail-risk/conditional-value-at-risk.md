# Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)

> Expected loss beyond the VaR threshold

---

## Overview

Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), also known as Expected Shortfall (ES) or Expected Tail Loss (ETL), measures the expected loss of a portfolio in the worst cases that exceed the Value-at-Risk threshold. By focusing on the average of extreme losses rather than just their frequency, CVaR provides a more comprehensive view of tail risk than traditional VaR.

## Key Principles

Conditional Value-at-Risk is built on these fundamental principles:

* **Beyond VaR**: Measures severity of tail events beyond the VaR threshold
* **Conditional Expectation**: Average loss given that loss exceeds VaR
* **Coherent Risk Measure**: Satisfies mathematical properties of coherent risk measures
* **Tail Focus**: Explicitly accounts for shape and heaviness of distribution tails
* **Risk Management**: Better suited for managing extreme event risk

## Quick Definition

CVaR at confidence level α is defined as the expected loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR threshold:

```
CVaR(α) = E[L | L ≥ VaR(α)]
```

Where:
- L represents the loss
- E[·|·] is the conditional expectation
- VaR(α) is the Value-at-Risk at confidence level α
