# Compliance Framework

> Comprehensive regulatory compliance monitoring, enforcement, and reporting system

---

## 1. Overview

The Compliance Framework establishes the structure, methodologies, and processes for ensuring VeritasVault's adherence to regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions. This document outlines the compliance architecture, rule implementation, monitoring systems, and reporting mechanisms that maintain the platform's regulatory integrity.

## 2. Compliance Architecture

### Key Components

* **Rule Engine:** Dynamic compliance rule implementation and execution
* **Identity Framework:** KYC/AML verification and ongoing monitoring
* **Transaction Monitor:** Real-time and batch transaction screening
* **Regulatory Reporter:** Automated report generation and submission
* **Documentation System:** Policy, procedure, and evidence management
* **Compliance Dashboard:** Monitoring, alerts, and compliance health metrics

### Architectural Principles

* **Regulation as Code:** Translating regulatory requirements into executable rules
* **Continuous Compliance:** Real-time monitoring versus periodic checking
* **Jurisdictional Awareness:** Adapting to location-specific requirements
* **Evidence by Design:** Built-in compliance evidence generation
* **Transparent Operation:** Clear traceability of compliance decisions
* **Graceful Degradation:** Failing safely when systems are impaired
