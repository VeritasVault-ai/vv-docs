# VeritasVault Risk Domain

> Real-time risk analytics and model validation

---

## 1. Purpose

The Risk domain provides comprehensive risk management and model validation capabilities across the VeritasVault protocol. It ensures safety, risk assessment, and monitoring for all operations.

## 2. Key Capabilities

* Real-time risk assessment and monitoring
* Financial model risk validation
* Portfolio risk monitoring
* Stress testing and scenario analysis
* Risk limits and controls
* Risk reporting and visualization

## 3. Core Modules

### Risk Management

* RiskModel: Real-time and historical risk assessment
* RiskFactor: Factor analysis of all protocol risks
* RiskLimits: Position and exposure limits
* PortfolioRisk: Portfolio-level risk monitoring
* StressTest: Scenario-based stress testing
* ModelValidation: Financial model validation framework

### Risk Controls

* LimitsEnforcement: Trading limits and caps
* ConstraintValidator: Portfolio constraint validation
* RiskReporting: Risk metrics and reporting
* RiskDashboard: Risk visualization and monitoring

## 4. Integration Points

* **Core Infrastructure:** For event sourcing and verification
* **Asset & Trading:** For position monitoring and limits
* **Governance:** For parameter validation and upgrades
* **External Interface:** For data analysis and reporting
* **Security:** For audit logging and compliance enforcement
* **AI/ML:** For advanced risk modeling and anomaly detection

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

* Basic risk monitoring
* Initial risk model implementation

### Phase 2: Enhancement
