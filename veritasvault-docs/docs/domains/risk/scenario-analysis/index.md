# Scenario Analysis

> Techniques for assessing portfolio performance under various market conditions

---

## Overview

Scenario analysis involves evaluating how a portfolio might perform under different potential market conditions or events. This approach helps investors understand potential vulnerabilities, stress points, and the overall resilience of their investment strategies across a range of possible future states.

## Scenario Analysis Methodologies

This section covers various approaches to scenario analysis and stress testing:

* **[Stress Testing](./stress-testing.md)**: Methodologies for assessing portfolio performance under extreme scenarios

## Key Concepts

* **Historical Scenarios**: Using past market events as templates for potential future stresses
* **Hypothetical Scenarios**: Constructing forward-looking scenarios based on potential future events
* **Reverse Stress Testing**: Working backward from an adverse outcome to identify scenarios that could cause it
* **Factor Sensitivity**: Testing response to movements in underlying risk factors
* **Scenario Construction**: Methodologies for developing coherent stress scenarios

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing scenario analysis, consider:

* **Scenario Selection**: Choosing relevant and plausible scenarios
* **Coherence**: Ensuring internal consistency in scenario assumptions
* **Severity Calibration**: Balancing between realistic and sufficiently stressful scenarios
* **Multi-Asset Impacts**: Accounting for cross-asset relationships in stress events
* **Response Planning**: Developing contingency plans based on scenario results

## Applications

Scenario analysis has multiple applications in investment management:

* **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and quantifying potential vulnerabilities
* **Portfolio Construction**: Building more resilient portfolios
* **Hedging Strategies**: Designing effective hedging approaches
* **Capital Planning**: Ensuring sufficient resources to weather stress events
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting regulatory stress testing requirements
