# Stress Testing Approaches

> Scenario-based methods for assessing portfolio vulnerabilities

---

## Overview

Stress testing is a forward-looking risk management technique that evaluates how a portfolio would perform under extreme but plausible adverse market conditions. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on historical data distributions, stress testing explicitly defines scenarios to assess vulnerabilities that may not be captured by traditional risk measures.

## Key Principles

Stress testing is built on these fundamental principles:

* **Beyond Statistics**: Looks beyond statistical distributions to specific scenarios
* **Narrative-Driven**: Combines quantitative analysis with qualitative judgment
* **Forward-Looking**: Focuses on potential future events rather than historical patterns
* **Vulnerability Identification**: Targets potential weak points in portfolio construction
* **Multiple Scenarios**: Considers various types of market stress and shock combinations

## Types of Stress Tests

### Historical Scenarios

* **Description**: Replicates significant market events from the past
* **Examples**: 1987 Black Monday, 2008 Financial Crisis, 2020 COVID Crash
* **Process**:
  1. Identify relevant historical crisis period
  2. Calculate asset price movements during that period
  3. Apply those movements to current portfolio
  4. Analyze resulting impact
* **Advantages**: Based on actual market behavior, intuitive interpretation
* **Limitations**: May not capture future risks, limited to observed history

### Hypothetical Scenarios

* **Description**: Constructs theoretical scenarios based on expert judgment
* **Examples**: Fed raises rates by 200bps, oil price doubles, equity market drops 30%
* **Process**:
  1. Develop scenario narrative
  2. Translate narrative into specific market movements
  3. Apply shocks to current portfolio
  4. Analyze resulting impact
* **Advantages**: Tailored to current concerns, can capture emerging risks
* **Limitations**: Subjective, challenging to assign probabilities

### Sensitivity Analysis

* **Description**: Tests portfolio response to changes in individual risk factors
* **Examples**: Interest rate shifts, volatility spikes, credit spread widening
* **Process**:
  1. Identify key risk factors
  2. Define range of factor movements
  3. Calculate portfolio sensitivity to each factor
  4. Analyze vulnerabilities to specific factors
* **Advantages**: Precise identification of key sensitivities, easier to implement
* **Limitations**: Misses interaction effects between risk factors

### Reverse Stress Testing

* **Description**: Works backward from a significant loss to identify scenarios that could cause it
* **Process**:
  1. Define critical loss threshold
  2. Identify combinations of factors that could produce that loss
  3. Assess plausibility of those scenarios
  4. Develop mitigating strategies
* **Advantages**: Identifies blind spots, focuses on material vulnerabilities
* **Limitations**: Computationally challenging, multiple possible solutions

## Implementation Methodologies

### Scenario Construction

#### Factor-Based Approach

* **Process**:
  1. Identify key risk factors affecting the portfolio
  2. Define stress level for each factor
  3. Apply factor shocks to all securities
  4. Aggregate impact at portfolio level
* **Applications**: Multi-asset portfolios with clear factor structure
* **Advantages**: Consistent application across portfolio
* **Limitations**: May oversimplify security-specific responses

#### Full Revaluation Approach

* **Process**:
  1. Define scenario parameters
  2. Revalue each security using appropriate pricing models
  3. Aggregate revalued positions
  4. Compare to original portfolio value
* **Applications**: Portfolios with non-linear instruments
* **Advantages**: Captures non-linear responses and complex interactions
* **Limitations**: Computationally intensive, model-dependent

#### Hybrid Approaches

* **Process**: Combine factor sensitivities with full revaluation
* **Implementation**: Full revaluation for complex instruments, factor-based for simpler ones
* **Advantages**: Balance between accuracy and efficiency
* **Limitations**: Consistency challenges across different methods

### Scenario Selection Methodologies

* **Expert Judgment**: Scenarios defined by risk managers, economists, portfolio managers
* **Regulatory Scenarios**: Standard scenarios required by regulators
* **Algorithmic Generation**: Systematic creation of scenarios that target portfolio vulnerabilities
* **Stakeholder Input**: Scenarios reflecting client or board concerns
* **Emerging Risk Assessment**: Scenarios based on emerging market trends or risks

## Applications in Portfolio Management

### Pre-Construction Analysis

* **Purpose**: Evaluate candidate portfolios before implementation
* **Process**: Apply stress tests to proposed allocations
* **Benefit**: Identify potential vulnerabilities before commitment
* **Integration**: Input to final portfolio design

### Risk Limits and Governance

* **Purpose**: Establish boundaries for portfolio risk
* **Process**: Define maximum acceptable losses under stress scenarios
* **Benefit**: Clear risk governance framework
* **Integration**: Regular reporting against stress limits

### Hedging Strategy Development

* **Purpose**: Design effective hedging approaches
* **Process**: Test effectiveness of hedges under various stress scenarios
* **Benefit**: More robust hedge design
* **Integration**: Optimization of hedge cost vs. protection

### Liquidity Management

* **Purpose**: Ensure sufficient liquidity during market stress
* **Process**: Analyze liquidity needs under stress scenarios
* **Benefit**: Anticipate funding requirements
* **Integration**: Liquidity buffer sizing and contingency planning

## Developing Effective Scenarios

### Key Components of Well-Designed Scenarios

* **Plausibility**: Unlikely but possible, not impossible
* **Relevance**: Targeting key vulnerabilities of specific portfolio
* **Severity**: Sufficiently stressful to provide meaningful insights
* **Coherence**: Internally consistent across risk factors
* **Clarity**: Clear narrative and cause-effect relationships
* **Actionability**: Leads to specific risk management actions

### Incorporating Market Dynamics

* **Correlation Shifts**: Accounting for correlation changes during stress
* **Market Liquidity**: Including liquidity deterioration effects
* **Feedback Loops**: Considering second-order effects and amplification mechanisms
* **Time Horizon**: Defining short-term shocks vs. prolonged stress periods
* **Market Participant Behavior**: Accounting for behavioral aspects of crises

### Common Scenario Types

| Scenario Type | Description | Key Factors | Example |
|---------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Equity Market Crash | Sharp decline in equity values | Equity prices, volatility, correlations | 30% market decline over 1 month |
| Interest Rate Shock | Sudden shift in yield curve | Interest rates, credit spreads, bond prices | 200bp parallel shift upward |
| Credit Crisis | Widening of credit spreads | Credit spreads, defaults, liquidity | 2x widening of all credit spreads |
| Liquidity Freeze | Market-wide liquidity contraction | Bid-ask spreads, market depth, funding costs | 50% reduction in market liquidity |
| Commodity Shock | Sharp move in commodity prices | Commodity prices, inflation, currency moves | Oil price doubles in 3 months |
| Currency Crisis | Severe currency devaluation | Exchange rates, interest rates, capital flows | 20% currency devaluation |
| Combined Scenario | Multiple stresses occurring together | Various interrelated factors | Stagflation with equity decline |

## Multi-Factor Scenario Design

### Correlation Considerations

* **Normal Correlations**: Baseline relationship between factors
* **Stress Correlations**: How relationships change during crisis

### Macro-Micro Integration

* **Top-Down**: Starting with macroeconomic scenarios, deriving asset class impacts
* **Bottom-Up**: Aggregating security-specific stresses to portfolio level
* **Integrated Approach**: Iterative consistency between macro and micro views
* **Time Dynamics**: Evolution of scenario impacts over different time horizons

## Stress Testing Program Development
