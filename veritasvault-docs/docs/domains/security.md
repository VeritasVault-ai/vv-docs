# VeritasVault Unified Security & Audit Standard  

> **Single Source of Truth** – All domain documents MUST reference this file for security‐related guidance. Duplication is prohibited.

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

VeritasVault operates under a **zero-trust, defense-in-depth** philosophy designed for adversarial and highly regulated environments.  
This standard defines mandatory controls, patterns, and processes for:

* Authentication, authorization, and access governance  
* Real-time threat detection, circuit-breaker containment, and incident response  
* Immutable, cryptographically signed audit logging  
* Multi-sig and time-lock protection for privileged operations  
* Rate-limiting and DoS safeguards at every boundary  

Every code change, deployment, or operational action MUST comply with the requirements herein.

---

## 2. Zero-Trust Architecture Principles  

1. **Verify Explicitly** – Every request is authenticated and authorized regardless of origin.  
2. **Least Privilege** – Grant minimum permissions required; default deny.  
3. **Assume Breach** – Design as if attackers are already inside; isolate blast radius.  
4. **Continuous Validation** – Runtime policy checks, anomaly detection, automated revocation.  

---

## 3. Defense-in-Depth Strategy  

| Layer | Controls |
|-------|----------|
| **Perimeter** | API Gateway auth (OAuth2/JWT), TLS 1.3, WAF rules, geo-fencing |
| **Application** | RBAC decorators, parameterized queries, SLA monitors, input validation |
| **Domain** | Invariant enforcement, signature checks, circuit breakers, multi-sig |
| **Contract / Chain** | Re-entrancy guards, pause switches, upgrade time-locks |
| **Infrastructure** | Network segmentation, container isolation, secrets rotation |
| **Observability** | Unified metrics, alert thresholds, anomaly ML models |
| **Governance** | Policy as code, automated attestation, mandatory reviews |

No single control failure can compromise critical assets.

---

## 4. Circuit Breaker Patterns  

* **Global Pause** – `SecurityController.pause()` halts state-changing functions platform-wide.  
* **Domain-Scoped Breaker** – Each artifact exposes `whenNotPaused(domain)` modifiers to isolate failures.  
* **Threshold Triggers** – Automated triggers on risk, slippage, or anomaly metrics.  
* **Manual Override** – Multi-sig signers can activate/deactivate breakers with on-chain record.  
* **Rollback Hooks** – Safe revert to last finalized state after breaker engagement.

---

## 5. Audit Logging Requirements  

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| **Immutability** | Append-only, signed with EIP-712 or BLS signature. |
| **Coverage** | Every privileged or value-changing action across all layers. |
| **Tamper Proof** | SHA-256 hash chain or Merkle tree anchored on-chain. |
| **Retention** | ≥ 5 years or per jurisdiction requirement (GDPR exempt data min). |
| **Real-Time Replication** | Logs forwarded to SIEM and cold storage within 60 s. |
| **Access** | Read-only APIs w/ audit role; exports in CSV, JSON, XBRL. |

Failure to log = failed transaction.

---

## 6. Access Control Patterns  

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Static roles (`ROLE_DAO`, `ROLE_ORACLE`, etc.).  
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** – Dynamic attributes (geo, risk score) for fine-grained API decisions.  
* **EIP-712 Signed Permits** – Gas-less approval flows with expiry.  
* **Time-Locked Privileges** – High-risk roles require timelock + quorum approvals.  
* **Separation of Duties** – Ops cannot approve code they author; treasury cannot deploy contracts.  

---

## 7. Multi-Signature Requirements  

| Operation | Threshold | Time-Lock |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Protocol Upgrade | 4/7 signers | 48 h |
| Treasury Transfer | 3/5 signers | 24 h |
| Emergency Pause Lift | 3/5 signers | 2 h minimum |
| Oracle Whitelist Change | 2/4 signers | 12 h |

Keys stored in HSM or hardware wallets; rotation every 6 months.

---

## 8. Rate Limiting & DoS Protection  

* **Token Bucket** at API Gateway (per key, per IP, per method).  
* **Dynamic Gas Policy** via `GasController` surge pricing to deter spam.  
* **RateLimit Breach Events** trigger auto-blacklist and alert severity **P2**.  
* **Per-Domain Quotas** – Asset mint, bridge transfer, trade execution quotas tiered by stake/KYC status.  

---

## 9. Security Incident Response  

1. **Detection** – Alert correlation via SIEM + anomaly ML models.  
2. **Classification** – Severity P0-P5 using NIST 800-61 criteria.  
3. **Containment** – Activate relevant circuit breaker(s); freeze compromised keys.  
4. **Eradication** – Patch or mitigate root cause; verify fix in staging.  
5. **Recovery** – Gradual resume; monitor for relapse; publish post-mortem within 72 h.  
6. **Lessons Learned** – Feed insights into threat model, playbooks, unit tests.  

Automated incident drills quarterly; red-team exercises bi-annually.

---

## 10. Cross-Domain Security Integration Points  

| From Domain | To Domain | Security Flow |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Core Infrastructure | Risk & Compliance | `SecurityIncidentDetected`, `GasPolicyUpdated` events |
| Asset & Trading | Governance | Trade caps, circuit-breaker thresholds reported for vote |
| Integration Gateway | Core | Verified cross-chain proofs, rate limit breaches |
| AI / ML | Risk | Anomaly scores feed risk engine; bias violations raise alerts |
| Cross-Cutting | All | Unified audit, monitoring, compliance gates |

All events travel via MessageBus with signature verification and replay protection.

---

## 11. Domain-Specific Implementation Guidelines  

| Domain | Mandatory Controls / Remarks |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Core Infrastructure** | Implement `SecurityController`, `RateLimiter`, VRF proof checks, chain reorg depth guard. |
| **Risk & Compliance** | Consume `SecurityIncident` events, enforce automated attestations, store signed audit hash chain. |
| **Asset, Trading & Settlement** | Enforce slippage / liquidity circuit breakers; settlement finality after `BlockFinalized + N`. |
| **Integration & Analytics** | Adapter sandboxing, bridge proof validation, OAuth2 + JWT audience checks, DLQ for failed messages. |
| **AI / ML Core** | Model hashes signed, canary deployments gated by fairness checks, inference quotas, safeguard against prompt injection. |
| **Governance, Ops & Custody** | Multi-sig enforcement, upgrade timelocks, incident escalations, scheduled tasks signed & replay-protected. |
| **Gateway** | WAF, API key rotation, MFA enforcement, content-security-policy headers, client-side rate limiting. |
| **Cross-Cutting Concerns** | Maintains central security policies, orchestrates drills, owns SIEM dashboards & threat intel feeds. |

Each domain’s README must link to this file under “Security & Compliance”.
