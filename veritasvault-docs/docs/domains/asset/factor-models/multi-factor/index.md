# Multi-Factor Models

> Approaches for combining multiple factors in investment strategies

---

## Overview

Multi-factor models address the integration of multiple investment factors into cohesive portfolio strategies. By combining several return drivers, these approaches seek to enhance diversification, improve risk-adjusted returns, and provide more consistent performance across market environments compared to single-factor approaches.

## Multi-Factor Content

This section covers approaches to multi-factor investing:

* **[Multi-Factor Models](./multi-factor-models.md)**: Methodologies for combining multiple factors effectively

## Key Concepts

* **Factor Combination**: Methods for integrating multiple factors
* **Factor Interaction**: Understanding how factors relate to and influence each other
* **Factor Allocation**: Approaches to weighting different factors
* **Factor Timing**: Considerations for dynamic factor allocation
* **Diversification Benefits**: Synergies from combining complementary factors

## Implementation Approaches

There are several approaches to implementing multi-factor strategies:

* **Integrated Approach**: Selecting securities based on combined factor scores
* **Sleeve-Based Approach**: Creating individual factor portfolios then combining them
* **Sequential Approach**: Applying factors in sequence as filtering mechanisms
* **Optimization-Based**: Using formal optimization to balance factor exposures

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing multi-factor strategies, consider:

* **Factor Selection**: Criteria for choosing which factors to combine
* **Weighting Methodologies**: Approaches to determining factor weights
* **Rebalancing Protocols**: Frequency and methodology for portfolio adjustments
* **Factor Correlations**: Accounting for relationships between factors
* **Implementation Costs**: Managing turnover and trading costs
