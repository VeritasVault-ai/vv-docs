# Equity Factor Models

> Types and characteristics of factor models for equity attribution

---

## Overview

Equity factor models provide a structured framework for decomposing portfolio returns based on exposures to systematic drivers of equity performance. These models identify and quantify the impact of fundamental characteristics, market behaviors, and risk factors that explain equity returns beyond traditional sector and country allocations.

## Key Principles

Equity factor models are built on these fundamental principles:

* **Return Decomposition**: Breaking down returns into systematic and idiosyncratic components
* **Risk Factor Identification**: Isolating persistent drivers of equity returns
* **Style Characterization**: Quantifying portfolio style exposures
* **Performance Explanation**: Explaining returns through factor exposures
* **Process Alignment**: Connecting investment process to performance outcomes

## Fundamental Factor Models

### Description

Fundamental factor models use directly observable company characteristics to define factors, providing intuitive and transparent insights into performance drivers.

### Common Fundamental Factors

* **Value Factors**:
  * Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
  * Price-to-Book (P/B)
  * Price-to-Sales (P/S)
  * Dividend Yield
  * Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)
  * Free Cash Flow Yield

* **Growth Factors**:
  * Earnings Growth (historical and projected)
  * Sales Growth
  * Cash Flow Growth
  * Book Value Growth
  * Profit Margin Expansion
  * Reinvestment Rate

* **Size Factors**:
  * Market Capitalization
  * Enterprise Value
  * Total Assets
  * Revenue Scale
  * Number of Employees
  * Free Float

* **Momentum Factors**:
  * Price Momentum (3, 6, 12 months)
  * Earnings Revision Momentum
  * Analyst Recommendation Changes
  * Relative Strength Indicators
  * Earnings Surprise Momentum
  * Industry Relative Momentum

* **Quality Factors**:
  * Return on Equity (ROE)
  * Return on Assets (ROA)
  * Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
  * Debt-to-Equity Ratio
  * Earnings Stability
  * Accruals Ratio

* **Volatility/Risk Factors**:
  * Historical Volatility
  * Beta
  * Specific Risk
  * Leverage
  * Liquidity Measures
  * Implied Volatility

### Implementation Approaches

* **Raw Factor Values**: Direct use of factor metrics
* **Z-Scores**: Standardized factor values
* **Percentile Rankings**: Relative positioning within universe
* **Industry-Relative**: Adjusted for industry norms
* **Multi-Metric Composites**: Combined multiple metrics within factor
* **Time-Series Smoothing**: Averaged over multiple periods

### Advantages

* **Intuitive Interpretation**: Clear economic meaning
* **Transparency**: Directly observable characteristics
* **Investment Process Alignment**: Connects to fundamental analysis
* **Customization Flexibility**: Can be tailored to specific strategies
* **Communication Value**: Easily explained to stakeholders
* **Forward-Looking Application**: Applicable to portfolio construction

### Limitations

* **Definitional Differences**: Varying definitions across providers
* **Multicollinearity**: Correlation between factors
* **Time-Varying Relevance**: Factors may gain/lose importance over time
* **Data Quality Dependence**: Requires accurate fundamental data
* **Sector/Country Biases**: May contain embedded sector/country effects
* **Structural Changes**: Company actions can create discontinuities

## Statistical Factor Models

### Description

Statistical factor models derive factors through mathematical analysis of historical returns, identifying common patterns without predetermined factor definitions.

### Common Approaches

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  * Identifies uncorrelated components explaining maximum variance
  * Factors are ordered by explanatory power
  * No predetermined economic meaning

* **Factor Analysis**:
  * Focuses on explaining correlations between securities
  * Attempts to identify latent factors
  * Can incorporate rotation for interpretability

* **Cluster Analysis**:
  * Groups securities with similar return patterns
  * Identifies common return drivers within clusters
  * Can reveal regime-specific factors

### Implementation Considerations

* **Number of Factors**: Determining optimal number of factors
* **Estimation Period**: Historical window for factor extraction
* **Regularization**: Techniques to improve stability
* **Interpretability Methods**: Approaches to add economic meaning
* **Updating Frequency**: Static vs. dynamic factor structure
* **Universe Selection**: Impact of security universe on factor identification

### Advantages

* **Maximum Explanatory Power**: Optimized for in-sample explanation
* **No Preconceptions**: Not limited by predetermined factor definitions
* **Correlation Management**: Produces uncorrelated factors
* **Data Efficiency**: Requires only return series
* **Adaptability**: Can identify emerging factors
* **Comprehensive Coverage**: Captures effects not in fundamental models

### Limitations

* **Lack of Intuitive Meaning**: Factors often lack clear interpretation
* **Instability**: Factor structure may change over time
* **Sample Dependence**: Sensitive to estimation period
* **Overfitting Risk**: May capture noise rather than signal
* **Communication Challenges**: Difficult to explain to stakeholders
* **Limited Forward Application**: Challenging to use in portfolio construction
