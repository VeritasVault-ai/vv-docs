# Factor Models and Attribution

> Methods for understanding and applying investment factors

---

## Overview

Factor models provide a framework for analyzing investments through the lens of systematic risk and return drivers. This section covers both theoretical foundations and implementation considerations for factor-based investing, with a focus on equity factor models and performance attribution.

## Contents

### [Equity Factor Models](./equity-factors/index.md)

Frameworks for understanding and implementing equity factor investing:
* [Equity Factor Models](./equity-factors/equity-factor-models.md) - Overview of equity factor model types
* [Equity Factor Implementation](./equity-factors/equity-factor-implementation.md) - Implementation approaches for equity factors

### [Multi-Factor Models](./multi-factor/index.md)

Approaches for combining multiple factors in investment strategies:
* [Multi-Factor Models](./multi-factor/multi-factor-models.md) - Combining multiple factors in portfolio construction

### [Performance Attribution](./attribution/index.md)

Methods for analyzing and decomposing investment performance:
* [Advanced Equity Attribution](./attribution/advanced-equity-attribution.md) - Sophisticated equity attribution techniques

## Key Concepts

* **Systematic Factors**: Identified drivers of return and risk
* **Factor Premia**: Expected returns associated with factor exposures
* **Factor Construction**: Methodologies for defining and measuring factors
* **Attribution**: Decomposing performance by factor contributions
* **Implementation Efficiency**: Capturing factor returns while managing costs

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing factor-based approaches, consider:

* **Factor Selection**: Criteria for choosing factors to include
* **Factor Stability**: Consistency of factor definitions and returns
* **Transaction Costs**: Impact of turnover on realized factor returns
* **Capacity Constraints**: Scalability of factor strategies
* **Market Conditions**: Factor performance across market regimes

## VeritasVault Implementation
