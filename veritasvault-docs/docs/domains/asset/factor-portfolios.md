# Factor-Based Portfolio Construction

> Strategic portfolio allocation based on underlying risk factors

---

## Overview

Factor-based portfolio construction moves beyond traditional asset allocation to focus on the underlying factors that drive returns. This approach allows investors to target specific risk premia and construct more efficient portfolios with better risk management and return outcomes.

## Core Concepts

### What Are Factors?

Factors are the underlying characteristics or exposures that explain asset returns. Common factors include:

* **Market**: Overall market risk premium
* **Size**: Small cap vs. large cap companies
* **Value**: Value vs. growth companies
* **Momentum**: Assets with positive momentum vs. negative momentum
* **Quality**: High-quality vs. low-quality companies
* **Volatility**: Low volatility vs. high volatility assets
* **Yield**: High dividend yield vs. low dividend yield

### Types of Factor Models

VeritasVault supports multiple factor modeling approaches:

#### Single-Factor Models

* **Description**: Portfolios built to capture exposure to one specific factor
* **Use Case**: Pure factor exposure for targeted investment strategies
* **Implementation**: Rank assets on factor, select/weight highest-ranking securities
* **Example**: Value-focused portfolio overweighting stocks with low P/B ratios

For details, see [Single-Factor Models](factor-models/equity-factors/single-factor-models.md).

#### Multi-Factor Models

* **Description**: Portfolios designed to balance exposure across multiple factors
* **Use Case**: Diversified factor exposure with reduced model risk
* **Implementation**: Combined scoring or sequential filtering approaches
* **Example**: Portfolio targeting value, momentum, and quality factors simultaneously

For details, see [Multi-Factor Models](factor-models/multi-factor/multi-factor-models.md).

#### Risk Factor Parity

* **Description**: Allocates risk budget equally across selected factors
* **Use Case**: Balanced factor exposure without inadvertent concentration
* **Implementation**: Factor covariance estimation, risk contribution equalization
* **Example**: Portfolio with equal risk contribution from value, quality, and low volatility factors

For details, see [Risk Factor Parity](../Risk/risk-measures/risk-factor-parity.md).

#### Factor Tilting

* **Description**: Strategic overweighting of specific factors within a diversified portfolio
* **Use Case**: Expressing factor views while maintaining diversification
* **Implementation**: Tactical adjustment of factor loadings based on outlook
* **Example**: Portfolio with market exposure and tactical tilt toward momentum in bull markets

For details, see [Factor Tilting Strategies](portfolio-management/factor-tilting.md).

## Implementation Process

The factor-based portfolio construction process follows these steps:

1. **Factor Selection**: Identify relevant factors based on investment objectives
2. **Factor Definition**: Define precise methodology for measuring each factor
3. **Factor Scoring**: Score securities based on their factor exposures
4. **Portfolio Construction**: Build portfolio using factor scores and constraints
5. **Factor Exposure Verification**: Verify the resulting portfolio achieves target factor exposures
6. **Risk Analysis**: Analyze unintended exposures and risks
7. **Implementation**: Execute trades to achieve target portfolio

## Advantages of Factor-Based Approaches

Factor-based portfolio construction offers several advantages:

* **Risk Transparency**: Better understanding of portfolio risk sources
* **Targeted Exposures**: Precise control over risk premia harvesting
* **Diversification**: Improved diversification across underlying drivers of return
* **Performance Attribution**: Enhanced ability to explain portfolio performance
* **Systematic Process**: Reduced behavioral biases in investment process

## Challenges and Considerations

Factor-based approaches come with specific challenges:

* **Factor Definition**: Factors may be defined differently across models
* **Factor Persistence**: Not all factors persist through all market regimes
* **Factor Timing**: Difficulty in timing exposure to different factors
* **Factor Crowding**: Popular factors may become crowded, reducing returns
* **Unintended Exposures**: Factor targeting may lead to unintended sector/country biases
