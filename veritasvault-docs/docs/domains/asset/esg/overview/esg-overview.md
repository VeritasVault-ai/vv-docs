# ESG Overview

> Introduction to environmental, social, and governance investment approaches

---

## Overview

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing incorporates non-financial factors into the investment process to identify risks and opportunities that traditional financial analysis might miss. This approach recognizes that companies' management of environmental impacts, social relationships, and governance practices can materially affect their long-term performance, risk profile, and sustainability.

## ESG Integration Map

Due to the breadth and complexity of ESG integration techniques, this topic is divided into several specialized documents:

* **[ESG Data Analysis](../implementation/esg-data-analysis.md)**: Sourcing, analyzing, and applying ESG data
* **[ESG Portfolio Construction](./esg-portfolio-construction.md)**: Building portfolios with ESG considerations
* **[ESG Reporting and Metrics](./esg-reporting-metrics.md)**: Frameworks and performance measurement
