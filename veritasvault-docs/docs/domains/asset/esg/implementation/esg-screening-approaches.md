# ESG Screening Approaches

> Methodologies for screening investments based on ESG criteria

---

## Overview

ESG screening approaches provide systematic methods for including or excluding investments based on environmental, social, and governance criteria. These methodologies help investors align portfolios with specific sustainability goals or values while maintaining a disciplined investment process.

## Key Screening Approaches

### Negative/Exclusionary Screening

* **Description**: Eliminating specific sectors, companies, or practices from the investment universe
* **Common Exclusion Categories**:
  * Product-based: Tobacco, weapons, gambling, adult entertainment, alcohol
  * Activity-based: Animal testing, genetic modification, nuclear power
  * Fossil fuels: Coal, oil sands, Arctic drilling, conventional oil and gas
  * Controversial weapons: Cluster munitions, landmines, biological/chemical weapons
  * Behavior-based: Human rights violations, corruption, environmental damage
* **Implementation Approaches**:
  * Binary exclusion (complete elimination)
  * Revenue threshold-based (e.g., >5% revenue from excluded activity)
  * Severity-based (based on involvement intensity)
* **Considerations**:
  * Impact on investment universe size and diversification
  * Tracking error implications
  * Definition of appropriate thresholds
  * Consistent application across conglomerates
* **Advantages**: Clear, easily communicated, direct values alignment
* **Limitations**: Reduces universe, potential sector biases, limited positive impact

### Positive/Best-in-Class Screening

* **Description**: Selecting companies with superior ESG performance relative to peers
* **Implementation Approaches**:
  * Top percentile selection (e.g., top 50% of ESG performers)
  * Minimum score threshold (e.g., ESG score > 7/10)
  * Sector-relative selection (top performers within each sector)
  * Improvement-based (companies showing significant ESG improvement)
* **Selection Criteria Options**:
  * Comprehensive ESG ratings
  * Specific ESG themes or metrics
  * Combined financial and ESG factors
  * Forward-looking ESG momentum
* **Considerations**:
  * Appropriate threshold determination
  * Sector neutrality vs. sector biases
  * Data quality and consistency
  * Rating methodology differences
* **Advantages**: Encourages improvement, maintains diversification, potential alpha
* **Limitations**: Dependence on ESG ratings quality, potential greenwashing

### Norms-Based Screening

* **Description**: Screening against minimum standards of business practice based on international norms
* **Common Norms Frameworks**:
  * UN Global Compact principles
  * ILO Conventions
  * OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
  * UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
  * Universal Declaration of Human Rights
* **Implementation Approaches**:
  * Violation identification and verification
  * Severity assessment
  * Engagement before exclusion
  * Monitoring and re-evaluation process
* **Considerations**:
  * Evidence verification challenges
  * Remediation assessment
  * Appropriate response to violations
  * Consistent application globally
* **Advantages**: Based on established international standards, objective criteria
* **Limitations**: Information availability, interpretation differences

### Thematic Screening

* **Description**: Selecting investments focused on specific sustainability themes or challenges
* **Common Themes**:
  * Climate change solutions
  * Water scarcity and management
  * Circular economy
  * Gender equality and diversity
  * Healthcare access and innovation
  * Financial inclusion
  * Sustainable agriculture and food
* **Implementation Approaches**:
  * Revenue threshold from theme-aligned activities
  * Impact metric thresholds
  * Theme-specific scoring systems
  * Combined theme and financial criteria
* **Considerations**:
  * Theme definition precision
  * Balancing theme purity and diversification
  * Avoiding theme-washing
  * Maintaining financial criteria
* **Advantages**: Clear sustainability focus, aligned with specific investor goals
* **Limitations**: Potentially concentrated portfolios, theme definition challenges

## Implementation Frameworks

### Screening Process Development

* **Criteria Definition**:
  * Establishing clear, objective screening criteria
  * Setting appropriate thresholds
  * Creating documentation of methodology
  * Developing exception processes

* **Information Sourcing**:
  * Third-party data providers
  * In-house research
  * NGO and specialist input
  * Company direct engagement
  * Verification mechanisms

* **Application Methodology**:
  * Frequency of screening application
  * Treatment of new information
  * Handling of borderline cases
  * Exception handling procedures
  * Re-evaluation timing

* **Monitoring and Updating**:
  * Regular review of criteria relevance
  * Process for criteria evolution
  * Corporate activity monitoring
  * Controversy tracking systems

### Combined Screening Approaches

* **Multi-Level Screening**:
  * Exclusionary first, then best-in-class
  * Norms-based first, then thematic
  * Layered screening approach with progressive filtering

* **Weighted Screening Systems**:
  * Scoring across multiple screening dimensions
  * Weighting different ESG criteria by importance
  * Minimum thresholds plus overall scoring

* **Dynamic Screening**:
  * Changing criteria based on engagement outcomes
  * Progressive tightening of standards over time
  * Adaptive thresholds based on market evolution

### Industry-Specific Screening Considerations

| Industry | Key Screening Considerations | Specialized Metrics |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Energy | Carbon intensity, transition plans | Scope 1-3 emissions, capex alignment |
| Materials | Resource use, pollution, biodiversity | Circular content, water usage, land impact |
| Financials | ESG lending policies, inclusion | Sustainable finance ratio, exclusion policies |
| Healthcare | Access, pricing, ethics | Affordability metrics, ethics violations |
| Technology | Data privacy, digital rights, governance | Privacy breaches, board independence |
| Consumer | Supply chain, product safety, marketing | Supplier audits, recall frequency |

## Practical Considerations

### Universe Impact Management

* **Diversification Impacts**:
  * Sector allocation shifts from screening
  * Geographic concentration effects
  * Market cap distribution changes
  * Assessing statistical significance of changes

* **Benchmark Implications**:
  * Tracking error estimation
  * Performance attribution effects
  * Sector/factor bias identification
  * Custom benchmark development

* **Liquidity Considerations**:
  * Universe size after screening
  * Impact on average security liquidity
  * Trading cost implications
  * Capacity assessment

### Implementation Challenges

* **Data Coverage Issues**:
  * Handling companies with limited data
  * Small cap coverage gaps
  * Emerging markets information limitations
  * Privately held company assessment

* **Screening Conflicts**:
  * Resolving contradictory screening outcomes
  * Balancing multiple screening objectives
  * Prioritization of competing criteria
  * Treatment of conglomerates with mixed activities

* **Transition Management**:
  * Implementing new screens in existing portfolios
  * Managing tax implications of screening changes
  * Client communication during transitions
  * Phased implementation approaches
