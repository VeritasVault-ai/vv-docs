# ESG Data Analysis

> Sourcing, analyzing, and applying ESG data in investment processes

---

## Overview

ESG data analysis involves the collection, processing, and interpretation of environmental, social, and governance information to inform investment decisions. As the ESG data landscape continues to evolve, investors face both opportunities and challenges in extracting meaningful insights from diverse and sometimes inconsistent information sources.

## ESG Data Landscape

### Data Source Types

* **Company Disclosures**:
  * Sustainability/ESG reports
  * Annual reports and financial filings
  * Regulatory disclosures
  * Corporate websites and press releases
  * Investor presentations

* **Third-Party Data Providers**:
  * Commercial ESG rating agencies
  * Specialized data vendors
  * NGO assessments
  * Academic databases
  * Industry-specific initiatives

* **Alternative Data Sources**:
  * Satellite imagery
  * Social media sentiment
  * Supply chain mapping
  * NGO reports and campaigns
  * News and media analysis

### Major Data Providers

* **Comprehensive ESG Raters**:
  * MSCI ESG Research
  * Sustainalytics
  * S&P Global ESG
  * Moody's ESG Solutions
  * ISS ESG

* **Specialized Data Providers**:
  * CDP (carbon and environmental data)
  * Trucost (environmental data)
  * RepRisk (ESG controversy data)
  * Equileap (gender equality data)
  * Science Based Targets initiative (climate data)

### Data Coverage and Limitations

* **Company Size Bias**: Better coverage of large caps vs. small caps
* **Geographic Variance**: Stronger data in developed vs. emerging markets
* **Public vs. Private**: More information on public vs. private companies
* **Sector Differences**: Varying disclosure quality across industries
* **Historical Limitations**: Limited time series and changing methodologies

## ESG Data Challenges

### Data Quality Issues

* **Inconsistent Reporting**: Varying disclosure practices across companies
* **Lack of Standardization**: Multiple reporting frameworks and metrics
* **Self-Reported Data**: Potential for bias in company-reported information
* **Data Gaps**: Missing information across companies and metrics
* **Timeliness**: Lag in data availability and updates

### Rating Divergence

* **Low Correlation**: Limited agreement between major ESG rating providers
* **Causes of Divergence**:
  * Different methodologies and metrics
  * Varying weighting schemes
  * Scope and boundary differences
  * Subjective judgment components
  * Treatment of controversies
* **Implications**: Need for multiple data sources, custom analysis

### Data Processing Challenges

* **Data Integration**: Combining diverse data formats and sources
* **Normalization**: Creating comparable metrics across companies
* **Missing Data**: Handling gaps and incomplete information
* **Outlier Management**: Identifying and addressing extreme values
* **Time Series Consistency**: Managing methodology changes over time
