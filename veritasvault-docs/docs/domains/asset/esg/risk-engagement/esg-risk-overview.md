> Introduction to ESG risk concepts and management approaches

---

## Overview

ESG risk management involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating environmental, social, and governance risks that could materially impact investment performance. As sustainability factors increasingly affect asset values and corporate performance, systematic approaches to managing ESG risks have become essential to fiduciary duty and investment stewardship.

## Key ESG Risk Categories

  * Water stress and scarcity
  * Biodiversity loss
  * Resource depletion
  * Land use and ecosystem degradation

* **Pollution and Waste Risks**:
  * Air and water pollution
  * Waste management issues
  * Toxic emissions
  * Packaging concerns

### Social Risks

* **Human Capital Risks**:
  * Labor relations and practices
  * Health and safety incidents
  * Workforce diversity issues
  * Talent attraction and retention

* **Human Rights Risks**:
  * Supply chain labor issues

  * Regulatory penalties
  * Product recalls
  * Consumer boycotts

* **Medium-Term Materiality**:
  * Regulatory changes
  * Litigation outcomes
  * Reputation damage
  * Market share shifts

* **Long-Term Materiality**:
  * Business model viability
  * Stranded asset risk
  * Systemic risk exposure
  * Competitive positioning

### Risk Interconnections

* **Risk Compounding**:
  * How environmental risks create social impacts
  * Governance failures amplifying environmental risks
  * Social tensions exacerbating environmental challenges
  * Cross-category risk amplification

* **Systemic Risk Considerations**:
  * Market-wide ESG risk factors
  * Correlation during sustainability crises
  * Tipping points and non-linear effects
  * System-level risk mitigation

### Dynamic Risk Evolution

* **Emerging Risk Identification**:
  * Early warning indicators
  * Trend analysis and horizon scanning
  * Expert network insights
  * Scenario planning

* **Risk Velocity Consideration**:
  * Speed of risk manifestation
  * Acceleration of sustainability trends
  * Tipping points in stakeholder expectations
  * Regulatory response timing

## Risk Assessment Frameworks

### Identification Methodologies

* **Materiality Assessment**:

* **Quantitative Assessment**:
  * Value-at-Risk (VaR) adaptations
  * Stress testing for ESG events
  * Sensitivity analysis
  * Probabilistic modeling

* **Qualitative Assessment**:
  * Expert judgment frameworks
  * Governance quality evaluation
