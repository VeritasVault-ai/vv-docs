# Climate Risk Management

> Managing investment climate risks and opportunities

---

## Overview

Climate risk management addresses the specific challenges that climate change poses to investment portfolios, including physical risks from extreme weather and changing climate patterns, transition risks from policy changes and technological shifts, and liability risks from legal and regulatory actions. As a significant subset of environmental risks, climate risks require specialized assessment and management approaches.

## Climate Risk Categories

### Physical Risks

* **Acute Physical Risks**:
  * Extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, wildfires)
  * Heat waves and cold snaps
  * Storm surge and coastal flooding
  * Short-term water stress

* **Chronic Physical Risks**:
  * Sea level rise
  * Changing precipitation patterns
  * Rising average temperatures
  * Long-term water scarcity
  * Changing disease patterns

* **Direct Physical Impacts**:
  * Asset damage and destruction
  * Supply chain disruption
  * Operational interruptions
  * Resource availability changes
  * Insurance cost increases

### Transition Risks

* **Policy and Legal Risks**:
  * Carbon pricing mechanisms
  * Emissions regulations
  * Energy efficiency standards
  * Disclosure requirements
  * Climate-related litigation

* **Technology Risks**:

## Climate Scenario Analysis

### Key Climate Scenarios

* **IPCC Climate Pathways**:
  * RCP 2.6 (Paris-aligned)
  * RCP 4.5 (Intermediate)
  * RCP 6.0 (High emission)
  * RCP 8.5 (Extreme scenario)

* **Transition Pathways**:
  * Orderly transition (early policy action)
  * Disorderly transition (delayed, sudden action)
  * Hot house world (limited climate action)
  * Net Zero 2050 (1.5°C alignment)

* **Financial Regulator Scenarios**:
  * NGFS climate scenarios
  * Bank of England stress test scenarios
  * ECB climate stress test scenarios
  * Fed climate scenario analysis

### Scenario Implementation

* **Process Steps**:
  1. Select appropriate scenarios
  2. Identify relevant parameters
  3. Map impacts to portfolio
  4. Quantify financial effects
  5. Analyze results and implications

* **Time Horizon Considerations**:
  * Short-term (1-5 years)
  * Medium-term (5-20 years)
  * Long-term (20+ years)
  * Time horizon alignment with assets

* **Sector-Specific Analysis**:
  * High-impact sectors (energy, utilities, transportation)
  * Medium-impact sectors (manufacturing, real estate, agriculture)
  * Lower-impact sectors (technology, healthcare, services)
  * Adaptation-focused sectors (infrastructure, insurance)

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### Carbon Footprinting

* **Metrics and Approaches**:
  * Absolute carbon emissions
  * Carbon intensity (per revenue)
  * Carbon intensity (per EVIC)
  * Weighted average carbon intensity
  * Avoided emissions

* **Scope Considerations**:
  * Scope 1 (direct emissions)
  * Scope 2 (purchased energy)
  * Scope 3 (value chain emissions)
  * Coverage completeness
  * Data quality assessment

* **Implementation Challenges**:
  * Data availability gaps
  * Estimation methodology differences
  * Scope 3 reliability issues
  * Point-in-time limitations
  * Forward-looking needs

### Climate Value-at-Risk
