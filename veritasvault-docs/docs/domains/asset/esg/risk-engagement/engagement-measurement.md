## Measurement Framework Components

### Success Criteria Definition

* **Company Action Criteria**:
  * Policy development or enhancement
  * Target setting with deadlines
  * Management system implementation
  * Disclosure improvement
  * Performance metric changes

* **Progress Indication Criteria**:
  * Acknowledgment of the issue
  * Commitment to address concerns
  * Action plan development
  * Initial implementation steps
  * Ongoing dialogue quality

* **Outcome-Based Criteria**:
  * Quantifiable performance improvement
  * Controversy reduction
  * ESG rating improvement
  * Industry leadership position
  * Enhanced disclosure quality

### Milestone Tracking System

* **Stage-Based Framework**:
  * Stage 1: Issue raised with company
  * Stage 2: Acknowledgment from company
  * Stage 3: Company commits to address issue

* **Traffic Light System**:
  * Red: No progress/response
  * Amber: Some progress but insufficient
  * Green: Satisfactory progress/resolution
  * Blue: Exceeds expectations/industry leadership

* **Numerical Scoring**:
  * 0-10 scale for progress assessment
  * Weighted scoring by objective importance
  * Progress scoring vs. absolute achievement
  * Benchmark-relative scoring
  * Cumulative improvement tracking
