p# Portfolio Construction Overview

> Approaches to Building Optimal Portfolios

## Overview

Portfolio construction in VeritasVault encompasses multiple methodologies for building investment portfolios that meet specific objectives while respecting constraints. This document provides an overview of the portfolio construction approaches available in the system.

## Key Approaches

### Mean-Variance Optimization

Traditional approach that balances risk and return:

* **Key Principle**: Maximize expected return for a given level of risk
* **Theoretical Basis**: Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)
* **Primary Inputs**: Expected returns, covariance matrix, risk aversion
* **Main Strength**: Mathematically optimal allocations
* **Main Challenge**: Sensitivity to input estimation errors

For details, see [Mean-Variance Optimization](./mean-variance-optimization.md).

### Risk-Based Portfolios

Approaches that focus primarily on risk management:

* **Minimum Variance Portfolio**: Minimizes overall portfolio volatility
* **Risk Parity**: Equalizes risk contribution from each asset
* **Maximum Diversification**: Maximizes diversification ratio
* **Most Diversified Portfolio**: Maximizes ratio of weighted average volatility to portfolio volatility

For details, see [Risk-Based Portfolios](./risk-based-portfolios.md).

### Factor-Based Portfolios

Portfolios constructed around exposure to specific factors:

* **Single-Factor Models**: Target exposure to one specific factor
* **Multi-Factor Models**: Balance exposure across multiple factors
* **Risk Factor Parity**: Equal risk allocation across factors
* **Factor Tilting**: Selective overweighting of specific factors

For details, see [Factor Portfolios](../factor-portfolios.md).

### Black-Litterman Portfolios

Approach combining market equilibrium with investor views:

* **Key Innovation**: Blends market-implied returns with specific views
* **Major Benefit**: More stable, diversified allocations
* **Core Components**: Market equilibrium, investor views, confidence levels
* **Main Applications**: Active management, view expression

For details, see [Black-Litterman Overview](black-litterman/black-litterman-overview.md).

## Construction Process

The portfolio construction process follows these general steps:

1. **Define Investment Universe**: Select eligible assets
2. **Prepare Inputs**: Gather required data (returns, volatilities, etc.)
3. **Select Construction Method**: Choose appropriate methodology
4. **Apply Constraints**: Incorporate investment constraints
5. **Generate Allocation**: Calculate optimal weights
6. **Validate Results**: Check allocation meets objectives and constraints
7. **Implementation Plan**: Create plan for implementing the portfolio

## Method Selection

Guidelines for selecting the appropriate construction method:

| Investment Goal | Recommended Approaches |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Maximum Return/Risk | Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman |
| Capital Preservation | Minimum Variance, Risk Parity |
| Factor Exposure | Factor-Based, Multi-Factor |
| View Expression | Black-Litterman |
| Diversification | Maximum Diversification, Risk Parity |
| Benchmark Tracking | Enhanced Indexing, Black-Litterman |
| Tail Risk Protection | Risk Parity, Min Conditional Value-at-Risk |

## Integration with Risk Management

Portfolio construction is tightly integrated with risk management:

* **Pre-Construction**: Risk limits and constraints inform construction
* **During Construction**: Risk metrics guide optimization
* **Post-Construction**: Constructed portfolio undergoes risk assessment
* **Ongoing Monitoring**: Risk changes trigger rebalancing or reconstruction

For more detailed information on specific approaches, refer to the specialized documentation for each method.
