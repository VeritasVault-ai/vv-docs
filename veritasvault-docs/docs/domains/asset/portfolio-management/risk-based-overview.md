# Risk-Based Portfolio Overview

> Introduction to Risk-Focused Portfolio Construction

---

## Overview

Risk-based portfolio construction focuses primarily on managing and optimizing risk characteristics rather than expected returns. These approaches address the challenges of return estimation sensitivity in traditional mean-variance optimization by focusing exclusively on risk parameters.

## Key Risk-Based Approaches

### Minimum Variance Portfolio

Portfolio with the lowest possible volatility:

* **Key Principle**: Minimize portfolio variance
* **Primary Inputs**: Covariance matrix only (no return estimates)
* **Main Strength**: Stability and defensiveness
* **Common Use Case**: Defensive allocations, volatility reduction

For details, see [Minimum Variance Portfolio](./minimum-variance-portfolio.md).

### Risk Parity Portfolio

Allocates risk equally across assets:

* **Key Principle**: Equal risk contribution from each asset
* **Primary Focus**: Balancing risk allocation
* **Main Strength**: Diversification across risk sources
* **Common Use Case**: Balanced risk exposure, all-weather portfolios

For details, see [Risk Parity Portfolio](./risk-parity-portfolio.md).

### Maximum Diversification Portfolio

Maximizes diversification across assets:

* **Key Principle**: Maximize the diversification ratio
* **Diversification Ratio**: Ratio of weighted average volatility to portfolio volatility
* **Main Strength**: Optimal diversification of risk sources
* **Common Use Case**: Maximizing diversification benefits

For details, see [Maximum Diversification](./maximum-diversification.md).

## Comparative Overview

| Approach | Primary Objective | Key Metric | Return Inputs | Main Benefit |
|----------|-------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| Minimum Variance | Minimize portfolio variance | Volatility | Not required | Lowest achievable volatility |
| Risk Parity | Equal risk contribution | Marginal contribution to risk | Not required | Balanced risk exposure |
| Maximum Diversification | Maximize diversification ratio | Diversification ratio | Not required | Optimal diversification |

## Common Characteristics

All risk-based approaches share these features:

1. **Return-Agnostic**: No need for expected return estimates
2. **Risk-Focused**: Prioritize risk management over return maximization
3. **Stability**: Generally produce more stable allocations
4. **Diversification**: Tend to create well-diversified portfolios
5. **Defensiveness**: Often perform well in market downturns

## Practical Considerations

When implementing risk-based portfolios:

1. **Covariance Estimation**: Quality of risk estimates is crucial
2. **Constraints**: Consider adding constraints to control allocations
3. **Rebalancing**: Regular rebalancing is important to maintain risk properties
4. **Transaction Costs**: Balance theoretical optimality against trading costs
5. **Sector/Factor Exposures**: Monitor for unintended concentrated exposures

## Implementation Framework

The general framework for implementing risk-based portfolios:

```typescript
interface RiskBasedPortfolioParameters {
  covarianceMatrix: Matrix;           // Asset covariance matrix
  approachType: RiskBasedApproach;    // Type of risk-based approach
  constraints: PortfolioConstraint[]; // Investment constraints
  assetUniverse: AssetId[];           // Assets to include
  additionalParameters?: any;         // Approach-specific parameters
}

enum RiskBasedApproach {
  MINIMUM_VARIANCE,
  RISK_PARITY,
  MAXIMUM_DIVERSIFICATION,
  MOST_DIVERSIFIED
}

interface RiskBasedPortfolioResult {
  weights: number[];                  // Optimal portfolio weights
  riskMetrics: RiskMetrics;           // Portfolio risk metrics
  diversificationMetrics: DiversificationMetrics; // Diversification measures
  riskContributions: number[];        // Asset risk contributions
}
```

For detailed implementations of each approach, see the specialized documentation for each method.
