# Black-Litterman Model

> Advanced framework for incorporating investor views into portfolio construction

---

## Overview

The Black-Litterman model provides a systematic approach to blending market equilibrium with investor views to create more intuitive and stable portfolio allocations. This section covers the theoretical foundation, implementation approaches, and practical applications of the Black-Litterman model in VeritasVault.
