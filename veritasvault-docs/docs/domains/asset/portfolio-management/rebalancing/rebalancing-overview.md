# Rebalancing Strategies: Overview

> Introduction to portfolio rebalancing concepts and approaches

---

## Overview

Portfolio rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio's assets to maintain the desired asset allocation. As market movements cause assets to drift from their target weights, rebalancing restores the portfolio to its intended risk-return profile. This document provides an introduction to rebalancing concepts and directs to specialized documents for detailed information.

## Rebalancing Strategy Map

Due to the breadth of rebalancing methodologies, this topic is divided into several specialized documents:

* **[Calendar-Based Rebalancing](./calendar-rebalancing.md)**: Time-based approaches to portfolio rebalancing
* **[Threshold-Based Rebalancing](./threshold-rebalancing.md)**: Trigger-based approaches using deviation thresholds
* **[Tactical Rebalancing](./tactical-rebalancing.md)**: Strategic and tactical overlay to rebalancing decisions
* **[Optimal Rebalancing](./optimal-rebalancing.md)**: Optimization techniques to balance competing objectives

## Why Rebalance?

* **Risk Control**: Prevents portfolio drift toward higher-risk assets
* **Disciplined Investing**: Enforces buy-low, sell-high behavior
* **Strategic Consistency**: Maintains alignment with investment objectives
* **Behavioral Benefits**: Removes emotion from selling winners and buying losers
* **Long-term Performance**: Potentially enhances risk-adjusted returns over time

## The Rebalancing Trade-off

All rebalancing approaches must balance several competing considerations:

* **Risk Alignment**: Keeping the portfolio close to target allocations
* **Transaction Costs**: Minimizing trading costs from frequent rebalancing
* **Tax Implications**: Managing tax consequences of realizing gains
* **Time and Resources**: Administrative burden of monitoring and execution
* **Market Opportunity**: Potential benefits of intentional drift in certain market conditions

## Key Considerations

When implementing a rebalancing strategy, consider:

* **Portfolio Characteristics**: Size, complexity, asset liquidity
* **Investment Constraints**: Transaction costs, taxes, legal restrictions
* **Implementation Resources**: Technology, staff, execution capabilities
* **Investor Preferences**: Risk tolerance, tax sensitivity, income needs
* **Market Environment**: Volatility, trending vs. mean-reverting conditions

For detailed explanations of specific rebalancing approaches, refer to the specialized documents linked above.
