# Settlement Module

> Framework for secure and efficient asset transaction settlement

---

## Overview

The Settlement Module provides comprehensive functionality for the secure, efficient, and verifiable settlement of asset transactions. It ensures that assets and funds are exchanged in a controlled manner with proper verification, atomicity, and finality guarantees.

## Core Responsibilities

### Settlement Processing

* **Transaction Validation**: Verifying transaction details and requirements
* **Settlement Workflow**: Managing the settlement process from initiation to completion
* **Status Tracking**: Monitoring and reporting on settlement status
* **Exception Handling**: Managing settlement failures and exceptions
* **Settlement Finality**: Ensuring transactions are irreversible once settled

### Atomic Operations

* **Atomic Transfers**: Ensuring all-or-nothing transaction execution
* **Multi-Asset Settlement**: Handling transactions involving multiple assets
* **Conditional Settlement**: Executing settlement based on specified conditions
* **Rollback Mechanisms**: Handling failures with proper state restoration
* **Consistency Guarantees**: Maintaining system consistency throughout settlement

### Settlement Batching

* **Batch Formation**: Grouping transactions for efficient processing
* **Netting**: Reducing settlement volume through obligation netting
* **Batch Scheduling**: Optimizing batch timing and composition
* **Batch Validation**: Ensuring batch integrity and consistency
* **Parallel Processing**: Handling multiple settlement batches simultaneously

### Settlement Verification

* **Cryptographic Verification**: Using cryptographic proofs for settlement verification
* **Audit Trail**: Maintaining comprehensive settlement records
* **Reconciliation**: Verifying settlement consistency across systems
* **Settlement Confirmation**: Generating and distributing settlement confirmations
* **Dispute Resolution**: Providing evidence for settlement disputes

### API Examples

```json
// Example: Settlement Instruction Creation
POST /settlement/instructions
{
  "type": "DVP",
  "parties": {
    "deliverer": "PARTY001",
    "receiver": "PARTY002"
  },
  "assets": {

## Settlement Models

### Delivery versus Payment (DvP)

* **DvP Model 1**: Gross, simultaneous settlement of securities and funds
* **DvP Model 2**: Gross settlement of securities, net settlement of funds
* **DvP Model 3**: Net settlement of both securities and funds
* **Advantages**: Eliminates principal risk
* **Implementation**: Atomic operations ensuring simultaneous exchange

### Free of Payment (FoP)

* **Free Delivery**: Securities delivered without payment
* **Use Cases**: Internal transfers, collateral movements, etc.
* **Risk Considerations**: No payment linkage creates counterparty risk
* **Controls**: Additional verification requirements for FoP transactions
* **Limitations**: Restricted use in regulated environments

### Payment versus Payment (PvP)

* **Currency Exchange**: Simultaneous exchange of currencies
* **Implementation**: Atomic operations for currency pairs
* **Foreign Exchange**: Supporting FX settlement
* **Risk Reduction**: Eliminating Herstatt risk
* **Integration**: Connecting with currency settlement systems
