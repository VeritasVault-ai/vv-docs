## 1. Best Practices (Phase 1 – MVP & Beyond)

### Architecture & Domain

* **Atomicity Everywhere:** All asset, trade, and settlement state transitions are atomic and revertible—no partial updates, ever.
* **Cryptographic Auditability:** Every event (asset, trade, settlement, limit/risk breach) is cryptographically signed and hash-proven; no event, no state.
* **Strict Boundaries:** Aggregate roots own only IDs, never object references. Cross-aggregate ops always via explicit interfaces/events.
* **Event Sourcing First:** All workflow and aggregate state is event-sourced. Recovery and replay are first-class, not afterthoughts.
* **Optimistic Locking/Versioning:** All order book and settlement flows implement concurrency via optimistic locking/versioning.
* **Portfolio Composition:** Portfolio management must support nested compositions, market cap weighting, and model-driven allocations.

### Interfaces & Implementation

* **Strong Typing:** All models, entities, and value objects are strictly typed; enums for all error/result types.
* **Composability:** Modular, upgradable contracts and services—no hidden or hard-coded dependencies.
* **Explicit Error Handling:** Every interface returns rich error/result objects (not just success/fail), including context and codes.
* **Domain Event Logging:** Emit, store, and publish events for all material state changes—no silent mutations.
* **Metrics Everywhere:** Expose metrics on order book depth, match engine latency, settlement finality, and risk events.
* **Investor View Management:** Structured capture and management of investor views for portfolio optimization models.

### Compliance & Security

* **Pre/Post-Trade Validation:** Compliance and risk controls are called both before and after every trade/settlement.
* **Circuit Breakers:** Systemic risk/circuit breaker checks on all matching, trade, and settlement flows; status is always queryable.
* **Immutable Audit Trails:** All trade/settlement events must be signed, timestamped, and immutable.
* **Data Provenance:** Asset metadata/state transitions must be hash-verified and provable.
* **Automated Compliance Checks:** Every critical workflow is blocked on compliance pass; no manual overrides.
* **Portfolio Constraints:** All portfolio optimization operations must respect regulatory and risk constraints.

## 2. Guidelines

* **Design for Rollback:** All aggregates must support rollback/replay via event logs; test rollbacks every release.
* **Type Safety:** Use value objects for all critical quantities (Money, Price, Quantity) to prevent unit or rounding bugs.
* **Saga Pattern for Settlement:** Settlement flows should be orchestrated using a Saga to ensure atomic, compensatable ops.
* **No Cross-Reference Pollution:** Aggregates reference only IDs, never objects—no hidden coupling or accidental side effects.
* **Version Everything:** All interfaces, events, and workflows must be versioned and backward-compatible unless explicitly deprecated.
* **Minimal On-Chain State:** Store only essential state on-chain; all historical/audit data should use off-chain proofs/audit logs.
* **Regular Risk Drills:** Schedule and execute periodic simulated risk events/circuit breaker triggers.
* **Portfolio Rebalancing:** Implement efficient rebalancing strategies that minimize transaction costs and slippage.
* **View Confidence Scaling:** Scale investor view confidence based on data quality and historical accuracy.
* **Allocation Constraint Management:** Ensure portfolio allocations satisfy diversification, position size, and sector exposure constraints.

## 3. Recommendations

* **Automate Everything:** Automation for tests, deployment, rollbacks, compliance, and audit log review is mandatory.
* **Continuous Penetration Testing:** Integrate pen-testing into CI/CD; audit for race conditions, settlement errors, and access controls.
* **Event-Driven Monitoring:** All key metrics, risk, and compliance triggers should have alert hooks for real-time ops visibility.
* **Documentation as Code:** Architecture, invariants, and interfaces should be documented in version-controlled markdown/diagrams—never in someone's head.
* **Monitor for "Silent Failures":** Implement watchdogs that flag missing events, unexpected state, or metric outliers.
* **Upgrade via Feature Flags:** Roll out new features/circuit breakers with toggles and staged activation to prevent systemic failures.
* **Portfolio Backtesting:** Thoroughly backtest portfolio optimization models under various market conditions before production use.
* **Market Cap Data Validation:** Implement robust validation for market capitalization data used in portfolio construction.
* **Allocation Visualization:** Provide clear visualizations of portfolio allocations, expected returns, and risk metrics.

## 4. Common Pitfalls (to Avoid)

* **Ignoring Rollback Testing:** If you can't test a rollback, you'll never trust your forward paths.
* **Soft/Ambiguous Errors:** Never allow "unknown error" returns—errors must be explicit, typed, and traceable.
* **Hidden Dependencies:** No module/service should rely on hidden or global state. All dependencies explicit, injected, and testable.
* **Unversioned Interfaces/Events:** Changing an interface or event contract without versioning breaks everything downstream.
* **Monolithic Aggregates:** Overgrown aggregates are brittle—design for cohesion, not catch-alls.
* **Skipping Metrics:** If you can't measure match latency or settlement time, you can't optimize or prove anything.
* **Manual Audit/Compliance:** Don't rely on manual checklists; automate audit/review flows and report anomalies by default.
* **One-Off Fixes:** Don't fix symptoms—find root causes, and automate the guardrails.
* **Inconsistent Asset Data:** Avoid inconsistencies in market data that could lead to flawed portfolio optimizations.
* **Missing View Documentation:** Always document the rationale behind investor views used in portfolio optimization.
* **Unbounded Allocation Sizes:** Implement strict position size limits to prevent overconcentration in any single asset.
