## 2. Executive Summary

### Business Impact

* Enables asset issuance, deterministic trading, atomic settlement, and portfolio management—all cryptographically auditable.
* Institutional adoption hinges on proof of integrity, risk controls, and compliance at every boundary.

### Technical Impact

* Canonical asset model, deterministic order book, and atomic settlement—with explicit position limits and proof-driven flows.
* **Critical enhancements:** Circuit breakers, pre/post-trade validation, order book depth tracking, portfolio risk metrics, asset metadata verification.
* Architecture is explicitly DDD, event-sourced, and versioned for concurrency and audit.

### Timeline Impact

* **Phase 1 (MVP):** Asset model, portfolio, orderbook, trade/settlement logic with concurrency, error handling, metrics, and proofs.
* **Phase 2:** Liquidity pools, provider logic, multi-asset portfolios.
* **Phase 3:** Advanced settlement, cross-chain swaps, liquidity optimization.
* **Phase 4:** Scale-out, secondary markets, and performance tuning.

---

## 3. Domain Overview

Asset, Trading & Settlement manages digital asset creation, permissioned and auditable trading, and atomic, cryptographically-proven settlement.
Every transaction, position, and state change is verifiable—compliance, audit, and rollback are hard guarantees.

---

## 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries (Strengthened)

### Core Functions (Critique-Enhanced)

* Asset lifecycle, metadata, and state transition with cryptographic verification.
* Deterministic, auditable trade matching with metrics and circuit breaker checks.
* Portfolio tracking, risk/position limits, rebalancing, and risk metric calculation.
* Atomic, auditable settlement with batch and proof support.
* Secure, event-driven integration with risk, compliance, and infra domains.

### Scope Definition

* **In Scope (MVP):** Asset, Portfolio, OrderBook, TradeExecution, Settlement, TradingRiskControls.
* **Out of Scope:** Liquidity pools/providers (Phase 2+), custody/treasury, upgrade logic, external bridges.

---

## 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD, MVP-Enhanced)

### Aggregate Roots

* **Portfolio:** Manages asset holdings by ID, validates position/risk limits, supports rebalancing/risk metrics.
* **OrderBook:** Open/matched/historic orders per pair, concurrency versioned, exposes order queue/depth/metrics.
* **Settlement:** Manages completed trades, batch/atomic operations, proof and event sourcing.

### Entities

* **Asset:** Canonical token/instrument, consist of a chain/symbol, state transitions are cryptographically verified.
* **Trade:** Executed record, links by ID only, generates proof, validated for compliance and risk.

### Value Objects

* **Order:** Immutable trade request.
* **SettlementResult:** Immutable, cryptographically proven.
* **AssetMeta:** Hash-verified metadata.
* **Money, Price, Quantity:** Type safety enforced.

### Domain Events (With Proof/Audit)

* AssetListed, AssetMetadataVerified, PortfolioUpdated, PortfolioLimitBreached, OrderMatched, OrderDepthChanged, TradeExecuted, TradeProofGenerated, SettlementFinalized, AtomicSettlementProofGenerated

### Repository Contracts

* **IPortfolioRepository:** Query/update/audit portfolio, validate risk/position limits.
* **IOrderBookRepository:** Query/match/archive orders, expose metrics, versioning.
* **ISettlementRepository:** Track/audit settlements by ID, proof trails, batch ops.
* **IAssetRepository:** CRUD for assets, metadata/state verification.

### Invariants / Business Rules

* Every asset/trade requires a cryptographically signed, immutable event trail.
* No order/trade/settlement state update without proof and explicit event.
* All matching and settlement are deterministic, versioned, and auditable.
* Position/risk/limits and compliance enforced at every workflow step.

## 7. Example Workflow (Saga, Event Sourcing, Audit)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User submits order] --> B[OrderBook: Place Order]
    B --> C[OrderBook: Match Orders (priority/depth/metrics/circuit)]
    C --> D[TradeExecution: Execute Trade + Generate Proof/Compliance]
    D --> E[Settlement: Initiate/Atomic/Batched/Proof]
    E --> F[Portfolio: Update Holdings, Validate Limits/Risk]
    F --> G[RiskControls: Circuit Breaker/Limit Enforcement]
```

## 8. Integration Points (Reinforced)

* Risk, compliance, circuit breaker (pre/post-trade, settlement)
* Core infra (block finalization, index, event stream)
* Audit log emission for every trade/settlement/limit/risk event
* Metrics/observability hooks for all workflow stages

**Liquidity pools, LP rewards, and AMM are deferred to Phase 2+ as planned.**

*If you need more granular code blocks, aggregate breakdowns, or a deeper risk/circuit breaker map, just say so.*
