## 2. Executive Summary (Upgraded)

### Business Impact

* Foundation for *provable*, resilient, and auditable protocol operation
* Enables transparent, cryptographically signed block finalization, data integrity, and event-driven workflows
* P0 for compliance, cross-domain auditability, and upgrade safety

### Technical Impact

* Defines all chain state/events as DDD aggregates—**all transitions event-sourced and hash-proven**
* **Hard-wired atomicity:** one block per height, finalization is cryptographically enforced, event log is immutable
* **Replayable** chain state with rollback, audit, and incident forensics as first-class flows
* All consensus, indexing, and event logic are versioned, modular, and circuit-breaker protected

### Timeline Impact

* Phase 1 (MVP): Core state/event engine, event log, consensus, index—by 7 June 2025
* Phase 2: Add multi-layer security, circuit breaker, gas/rate controls (Q3 2025)
* Phase 3: Add cross-chain/VRF/adapters (Q4 2025)
* Phase 4: Add governance, fork/upgrade management (Q1 2026)

---

## 3. Domain Overview (Critique Enhanced)

The Core Infrastructure domain is the *zero-trust*, event-sourced, DDD-aligned backbone of the protocol. Every state change, block, or event is cryptographically proven and replayable—no deploy without audit, no upgrade without version/compatibility proof.

**Criticality: P0 (Mission Critical, Compliance Gatekeeper)**

---

## 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries (Hardened)

### Core Functions

* Finalize and hash-prove chain state; *no block finalized without consensus event and proof*
* Index/snapshot all block data—**all states must be replayable and rollbackable**
* Emit, store, and replay domain events—all events are hash-anchored and signed
* Enforce chain data integrity and prevent all double-finalization, rollback every state change
* Monitor/circuit-break all state transitions for rate, gas, and incident conditions

### Scope

* **In:** ConsensusManager, ChainIndexer, EventEmitter, DDD aggregates, repo contracts, event/state log, circuit breaker
* **Out:** App logic, cross-chain (Phase 3+), governance (Phase 4), business features

---

## 5. Domain Model (Enhanced DDD)

### Aggregate Roots & Entities

* **BlockChain (Agg Root):** Manages chain state, blocks, finalization, consensus invariants, event log reference
* **Block (Entity):** Finalized block w/ metadata, block hash, cryptographic proof
* **BlockHeader (Entity):** Block metadata: number, timestamp, parent hash, proof, event root
* **StateSnapshot (Entity):** Snapshot of chain state at finalized block; must be rollback/replay tested

### Value Objects

* **ConsensusState:** Immutable; includes hash, validator signatures, proof chain
* **BlockHash:** Unique, derived from full block content/events/proofs
* **EventProof:** Hash/sig proof for every event emitted

### Domain Events (Signed/Auditable)

* **BlockFinalized, BlockIndexed, ChainReorg, CircuitBreakerTriggered, RollbackPerformed, EventLogPruned**

### Repository Contracts

* **IBlockRepository:**

  * `saveBlock(Block block)`
  * `getBlockByHash(BlockHash hash)`
  * `getBlocksByHeight(uint256 height)`
  * `saveSnapshot(StateSnapshot snapshot)`
  * `getSnapshot(uint256 blockNumber)`
  * `pruneEvents(uint256 beforeBlock)`

---

## 6. Invariants & Business Rules (Enhanced)

* Each block finalized *exactly once*; consensus event/sig required
* Consensus state must match every indexed block/snapshot
* Rollbacks must be possible for all non-final blocks; rollback audit trails required
* Snapshots created for finalized blocks only; events must be immutable and signed
* All event emissions logged and *replay tested*; circuit breaker on abnormal rate/size

---

## 7. Implementation Strategy (Phased, Provable)

* Phase 1: Deliver core aggregates, repo/event log, event replay and rollback, event/circuit breaker test harness
* Phase 2: Add SecurityController, RateLimiter, GasController, CircuitBreaker
* Phase 3: Add ChainAdapter, RandomnessOracle, VRF, cross-chain support
* Phase 4: Add ForkManager, GovernanceController, upgrade/fork/version control

---

## 8. Operations Guide (MVP+)

* **Monitoring:** Chain state, block/event finalization, event log growth, circuit breaker status
* **Alerting:** Finalization failures, consensus mismatches, abnormal event rates, circuit breaker triggers
* **Incident Response:** Rollback/replay, manual intervention, event pruning, audit trail review
* **Maintenance:** Repository backup, snapshot integrity, event log/circuit breaker test scheduling

---

## 9. Resource Planning (Hardened)

* Storage for blocks/snapshots/events (resilient, queryable, audit-locked)
* Monitoring dashboard (block state, event/circuit status, rollback metrics)
* 2–3 engineers MVP, add 1–2 for security/circuit breaker in Phases 2–4

## 10. Risk & Compliance (Strengthened)

| Phase | Risk              | Mitigation                             |
| ----- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Consensus failure | Fallback/replay/circuit breaker        |
| 2     | Security breach   | Multi-layer, circuit, event proof      |
| 3     | Cross-chain error | Message verification, audit log        |
| 4     | Upgrade/fork bugs | Versioning, compatibility test, replay |

---

## 11. Quality Assurance (Provable, Auditable)

* > 90% unit/integration test coverage for all aggregates/events/circuit logic
* Manual + automated replay/rollback test for event log and snapshots
* Circuit breaker/emergency/incident drill schedule
* Every release must pass replay/rollback/circuit breaker drills and audit

---

## 12. Integration Guide (Explicit)

* API contracts: block repo, event log, event proof/circuit breaker status
* Integration: SecurityController, future cross-chain/oracle adapters, circuit breaker hooks
* Document: Domain events, event log API, rollback/replay usage, circuit breaker integration

---

## 13. References

* Internal: Architecture spec, event log/circuit breaker doc, DDD/circuit test cases
* External: Ethereum yellow paper, Cosmos SDK docs, EIP circuit breaker/disaster recovery

* **Owner(s):** Core Lead Architect
* **Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-24 (Critique Enhanced)
* **Change Log:**

  | Version | Date       | Author         | Changes          | Reviewers          |
  | ------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
  | 1.0.1   | 2025-05-24 | Core Architect | Critique Upgrade | Protocol, Security |
  
* **Review Schedule:** Monthly; next review 2025-06-24

**Summary:**

* No finalized block or event is valid without consensus proof and event log hash. Rollback, replay, and audit are not features—they are baseline requirements. Any gap in event replay or rollback must block release.

*If you want C4, sequence diagrams, or explicit circuit breaker workflow, ask and it’ll be added fast.*
