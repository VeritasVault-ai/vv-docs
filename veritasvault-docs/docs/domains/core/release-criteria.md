# Release Criteria & Compliance Gates

> Quality Assurance Requirements for Core Infrastructure

---

## Overview

This document defines the minimum requirements that must be met before any component of the VeritasVault Core Infrastructure can be released to production. These criteria ensure the system maintains its security, reliability, and performance guarantees.

## Critical Requirements

The following gaps are considered showstoppers for any release:

* **Any gap in event sourcing**: All state changes must be recorded as events
* **Any gap in rollback capability**: System must be able to revert to previous states
* **Any gap in circuit breaker protection**: Emergency stops must be available for all critical functions

## Component Compliance

All modules, interfaces, and deployment artifacts must pass the following verification steps before production deployment:

### Replay Testing

* **Full state replay**: Demonstrate ability to rebuild state from event history
* **Partial replay**: Verify selective replay of specific event categories
* **Performance validation**: Confirm replay performance meets requirements
* **Integrity checks**: Verify state consistency after replay operations

### Rollback Procedures

* **Clean rollback**: Verify ability to revert to previous states without side effects
* **Partial rollback**: Demonstrate selective state reversal capabilities
* **Coordinated rollback**: Test multi-component state consistency during rollback
* **Rollback authorization**: Verify proper access controls on rollback operations

### Incident Response

* **Automated detection**: Confirm monitoring systems detect abnormal conditions
* **Alert propagation**: Verify alerts reach appropriate personnel
* **Response procedures**: Validate documented response for each critical scenario
* **Recovery time**: Measure and validate recovery time objectives

## Operational Readiness

### Monitoring & Observation

The following monitoring must be in place for each module and cross-domain flow:

* **Health metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
* **Application metrics**: Request rates, error rates, latency distributions
* **Business metrics**: Transaction volumes, value flows, user activities
* **Security metrics**: Authentication attempts, access violations, unusual patterns

### Testing Coverage

Test coverage requirements include:

* **Unit tests**: 90%+ code coverage for all components
* **Integration tests**: All component interfaces tested with normal and abnormal inputs
* **End-to-end tests**: Complete workflow validation across components
* **Chaos tests**: System resilience under degraded conditions
* **Load tests**: Performance validation under peak and sustained load

#### Risk-Based Testing Prioritization

Testing resources must be allocated based on business impact and risk assessment:

* **Critical Path Testing**: Prioritize testing of components on the critical transaction path
* **Risk-Weighted Coverage**: Allocate test resources proportional to component risk scores
* **Impact Analysis**: Focus testing on changes with the highest potential business impact
* **Vulnerability-Driven Testing**: Prioritize testing of previously vulnerable components
* **User Journey Criticality**: Emphasize testing of high-value user journeys

#### Test Data Factory Implementation

Comprehensive test data generation must be implemented to ensure edge case coverage:

* **Synthetic Data Generation**: Automated creation of test data covering edge cases
* **Boundary Value Factories**: Specialized factories for boundary condition testing
* **Randomized Fuzzing**: Structured random data generation for unexpected inputs
* **Historical Scenario Replay**: Test factories based on historical edge cases
* **Cross-Domain Data Consistency**: Test data that maintains cross-domain integrity

#### Testing Hierarchies

A clear testing hierarchy must be established to define critical vs. nice-to-have paths:

* **P0 Tests**: Must-pass tests for critical functionality and security
* **P1 Tests**: High-priority tests for core business functionality
* **P2 Tests**: Standard tests for general functionality
* **P3 Tests**: Nice-to-have tests for edge cases and enhancements
* **Integration Criticality**: Clear designation of critical vs. optional integration paths

### Documentation Requirements

All components must be documented with:

* **API specifications**: Complete interface documentation
* **Operational procedures**: Routine maintenance and troubleshooting guides
* **Architecture diagrams**: Current and accurate system design documentation
* **Runbooks**: Step-by-step procedures for common operational tasks

## Financial Component Requirements

Financial data storage and computation components must undergo additional validation:

### Stress Testing

* **Surge capacity**: Handle 10x normal load without degradation
* **Recovery testing**: Return to normal operation after extreme conditions
* **Data volume testing**: Validate performance with historical data volumes
* **Concurrent access**: Maintain performance under multi-user scenarios

### Data Validation

* **Input validation**: Verify all inputs are validated before processing
* **Anomaly detection**: Confirm outlier detection for unusual financial data
* **Consistency checks**: Validate internal data consistency across operations
* **Reference data**: Verify alignment with canonical reference data

## Model Governance

All financial models must have the following safeguards before production use:

### Circuit Breakers

* **Input-based**: Halt on anomalous input data
* **Output-based**: Prevent implausible results from propagating
* **Resource-based**: Stop excessive resource consumption
* **Time-based**: Set maximum execution time boundaries

### Validation Gates

* **Backtesting**: Validate against historical scenarios
* **Sensitivity analysis**: Understand response to input variations
* **Benchmark comparison**: Compare against established models
* **Expert review**: Validation by domain experts

## Release Process

The official release process requires:

1. **Change proposal**: Documented purpose and scope of changes
2. **Risk assessment**: Identification of potential impacts and mitigations
3. **Peer review**: Code and design review by relevant experts
4. **Testing verification**: Confirmation of test coverage and results
5. **Approval workflow**: Formal sign-off by designated authorities
6. **Deployment plan**: Detailed implementation steps with rollback procedures
7. **Post-deployment validation**: Verification of successful deployment
