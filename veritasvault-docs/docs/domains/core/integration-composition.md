# Integration & Composition

> Component Interaction Patterns & System Architecture

---

## Overview

This document outlines how the VeritasVault Core Infrastructure components integrate with each other and with higher-level system modules. The architecture follows principles of composability, testability, and maintainability.

## Core Architectural Principles

* **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces
* **Loose Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined contracts
* **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped within the same component
* **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions, not implementations
* **Explicit Integration Points**: All cross-component interactions are documented

## Component Integration Patterns

### Module Independence

All infrastructure modules are designed to be:

* **Independently Testable**: Each module can be tested in isolation
* **Independently Auditable**: Security reviews can be conducted at the module level
* **Independently Deployable**: Modules can be updated separately (when appropriate)
* **Independently Scalable**: Resource allocation can be adjusted per module

### Cross-Module Integration

Core modules integrate with each other through:

* **Event Sourcing**: State changes are propagated as events
* **Command Patterns**: Operations are encapsulated as commands
* **Service Interfaces**: Capabilities are exposed through defined interfaces
* **Configuration Injection**: Modules receive configuration from central sources

## Enhanced Integration Monitoring

### Cross-Module Dependency Tracking

The system implements comprehensive dependency tracking to ensure reliable cross-module integration:

* **Dependency Graph Visualization**: Real-time visualization of module dependencies
* **Circular Dependency Detection**: Automated identification of problematic circular dependencies
* **Dependency Health Metrics**: Monitoring of dependency performance and reliability
* **Dependency Version Tracking**: Tracking of interface versions and compatibility

### Integration Health Dashboards

Dedicated dashboards provide visibility into the health of cross-module integrations:

* **Integration Status Overview**: High-level view of all integration points
* **Latency Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of cross-module communication latency
* **Error Rate Tracking**: Monitoring of failures at integration boundaries
* **Throughput Visualization**: Visualization of message volume across integration points
* **Circuit Breaker Status**: Current state of all integration circuit breakers

### Service-Level Agreements

Formal SLAs are established between modules to ensure reliable integration:

* **Response Time Requirements**: Maximum acceptable latency for cross-module requests
* **Availability Guarantees**: Uptime requirements for each module
* **Error Rate Thresholds**: Maximum acceptable error rates at integration points
* **Throughput Commitments**: Guaranteed message processing capacity
* **Recovery Time Objectives**: Maximum time to recover from failures

## Higher-Level Integration

### Protocol Security Integration

Security-focused modules provide infrastructure for all higher layers:

* **ProtocolSecurityManager** provides unified security services including:
  * RBAC for all privileged operations
  * Protection for all public-facing interfaces
  * Economic viability enforcement for all operations

### AI Module Integration

Core infrastructure provides essential services for AI components:

* **TimeSeriesStore** supplies efficient storage for model training data
* **ComputeOrchestrator** manages resources for model execution
* **RandomnessOracle** provides unpredictable inputs when required

### DeFi Module Integration

Financial components rely on core infrastructure for:

* **ChainIndexer** to track on-chain financial events
* **ConsensusManager** to ensure financial transaction finality
* **TimeSeriesStore** for market data management

## Cross-Chain Capabilities

### Chain Abstraction

The ChainAdapter enables seamless migration or extension to future L1/L2s by:

* **Normalizing Configurations**: Providing consistent settings across chains
* **Abstracting Protocol Differences**: Hiding chain-specific implementations
* **Coordinating Cross-Chain State**: Managing state consistency across chains
* **Maintaining Compatibility**: Ensuring operations work across supported chains

## Data Management Integration

### Time Series Data

The TimeSeriesStore provides optimized storage for financial model data by:

* **Efficient Storage**: Using specialized time-series compression
* **Indexed Access**: Providing fast lookup by time ranges
* **Aggregation Support**: Enabling various time-based rollups
* **Versioning**: Maintaining historical versions of time series

## Computational Resource Management

### Resource Orchestration

The ComputeOrchestrator manages resources for computation-intensive operations by:

* **Scheduling**: Prioritizing and queuing computation jobs
* **Monitoring**: Tracking resource usage and performance
* **Scaling**: Dynamically adjusting resource allocation
* **Isolation**: Preventing resource contention between operations

* Data Flow Architecture

## Deployment Considerations

Integration testing should focus on:

* **Boundary Conditions**: Edge cases at integration points
* **Failure Modes**: Graceful degradation when components fail
* **Performance Characteristics**: Latency and throughput at interfaces
* **Security Implications**: Authorization and access control enforcement
