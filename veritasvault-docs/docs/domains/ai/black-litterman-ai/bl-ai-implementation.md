## Getting Started

To implement the Black-Litterman AI Integration:

1. Start with the [Implementation Overview](./implementation/bl-ai-implementation-overview.md) to set up your environment
2. Implement each component group according to your requirements
3. Follow the [Integration Architecture Implementation](./implementation/bl-ai-implementation-integration.md) to bring all components together
4. Test, validate, and deploy the system following the governance guidelines

## Implementation Requirements

* Python 3.8+ environment
* Machine learning and data science libraries
* Financial data sources and infrastructure
* Model training and serving capabilities
* Monitoring and governance infrastructure

For specific requirements and dependencies, refer to each dedicated implementation file.
