# KL Divergence: Definition

> Mathematical definition and properties of KL divergence for covariance matrices

---

## 1. Mathematical Definition

### General KL Divergence

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions P and Q. For continuous probability distributions, it is defined as:

$$ D_{KL}(P||Q) = \int p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx $$

Where:
- $p(x)$ is the probability density function of distribution P
- $q(x)$ is the probability density function of distribution Q

KL divergence is always non-negative, and equals zero if and only if P and Q are identical distributions.

### Interpretations

KL divergence can be interpreted as:

1. **Information Gain**: The information gained when updating beliefs from prior Q to posterior P
2. **Coding Inefficiency**: Extra bits needed when using code optimized for Q to encode data from P
3. **Statistical Distance**: A measure of how one distribution differs from another (though not a true metric)

## 2. KL Divergence for Multivariate Gaussians

### Closed-Form Expression

For covariance matrices, KL divergence is typically applied to multivariate Gaussian distributions. If we have:

- Distribution P: $\mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)$ 
- Distribution Q: $\mathcal{N}(\mu_2, \Sigma_2)$

The KL divergence has the closed-form expression:

$$ D_{KL}(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \log \frac{|\Sigma_2|}{|\Sigma_1|} + \text{Tr}(\Sigma_2^{-1} \Sigma_1) + (\mu_2 - \mu_1)^T \Sigma_2^{-1} (\mu_2 - \mu_1) - n \right] $$

Where:
- $|\Sigma|$ denotes the determinant of matrix $\Sigma$
- $\text{Tr}()$ is the trace operator
- $n$ is the dimension of the distributions

### Special Case for Covariance Estimation

In covariance estimation, we often assume the means are known (typically zero or identical), simplifying to:

$$ D_{KL}(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \log \frac{|\Sigma_2|}{|\Sigma_1|} + \text{Tr}(\Sigma_2^{-1} \Sigma_1) - n \right] $$

## 3. Properties Relevant to Shrinkage Estimation

### Asymmetry

KL divergence is asymmetric: $D_{KL}(P||Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q||P)$ in general. This has important implications:

- $D_{KL}(P||Q)$: Penalizes when Q assigns low probability to regions where P has high probability
- $D_{KL}(Q||P)$: Penalizes when P assigns low probability to regions where Q has high probability

For covariance estimation, this asymmetry requires careful consideration of which distribution should be the reference.

### Behavior with Singular Matrices

KL divergence is undefined if $\Sigma_2$ is singular, as it requires the inverse $\Sigma_2^{-1}$. This is particularly relevant for sample covariance matrices in high-dimensional settings.

### Scale Sensitivity

The KL divergence is sensitive to the scale of the covariance matrices. Errors in larger eigenvalues tend to be penalized more heavily than errors in smaller eigenvalues.

### Relative Error Focus

KL divergence naturally emphasizes relative errors rather than absolute errors, unlike Frobenius norm which treats all elements equally.

## 4. Jeffreys Divergence

### Symmetrized KL Divergence

To address the asymmetry of KL divergence, Jeffreys divergence provides a symmetrized alternative:

$$ D_J(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2}[D_{KL}(P||Q) + D_{KL}(Q||P)] $$

For multivariate Gaussians with the same mean:

$$ D_J(P||Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \text{Tr}(\Sigma_2^{-1} \Sigma_1) + \text{Tr}(\Sigma_1^{-1} \Sigma_2) - 2n \right] $$

### Relevance to Shrinkage

The symmetrized version can be beneficial in shrinkage estimation when there's no clear reference distribution, treating both the shrinkage estimate and the target/true covariance equally.

## 5. Information-Theoretic Perspective

### Connection to Entropy

KL divergence can be expressed in terms of entropy:

$$ D_{KL}(P||Q) = H(P, Q) - H(P) $$

Where:
- $H(P)$ is the entropy of P
- $H(P, Q)$ is the cross-entropy between P and Q

### Maximum Entropy Principle

This connection is especially relevant for shrinkage targets based on maximum entropy principles, where the target represents a distribution with minimal assumptions.
