# Time Series Fundamentals

> Core concepts and statistical properties of financial time series

---

## Overview

Time series fundamentals are essential for understanding, modeling, and forecasting financial data within the VeritasVault platform. This document covers the foundational concepts, statistical properties, and analytical techniques that underpin all time series forecasting methodologies.

## Statistical Properties of Financial Time Series

### Stationarity

* **Definition:**
  * A time series is stationary when its statistical properties remain constant over time
  * Weak stationarity requires constant mean, variance, and autocovariance
  * Strong stationarity requires the entire distribution to be time-invariant

* **Tests for Stationarity:**
  * Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
  * Phillips-Perron (PP) test
  * Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test
  * Variance ratio tests

* **Financial Implications:**
  * Most financial time series are non-stationary
  * Returns tend to be more stationary than prices
  * Volatility clustering creates challenges for stationarity assumptions
  * Regime shifts can invalidate stationarity even for return series

### Transformations for Stationarity

* **Differencing:**
  * First differences: Remove trends (returns from prices)
  * Second differences: Remove acceleration effects
  * Seasonal differencing: Remove cyclical patterns

* **Mathematical Transformations:**
  * Logarithmic transformation: Stabilize variance, convert multiplicative to additive
  * Box-Cox transformation: Generalized power transformation
  * Variance stabilizing transformations
  * Rank-based transformations

* **Trend and Seasonality Removal:**
  * Detrending methods
  * Seasonal adjustment techniques
  * Decomposition approaches
  * Filtering methods

## Autocorrelation Analysis

### Autocorrelation Function (ACF)

* **Definition:**
  * Correlation between a time series and its lagged values
  * Measures linear dependencies at different lags
  * Ranges from -1 to 1

* **Interpretation:**
  * Significant positive autocorrelation: Momentum effects
  * Significant negative autocorrelation: Mean reversion
  * Decay patterns: Persistence of information
  * Seasonality: Repeating patterns at fixed intervals

* **Financial Applications:**
  * Market efficiency testing
  * Return predictability assessment
  * Trading signal generation
  * Model specification guidance

### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)

* **Definition:**
  * Correlation between a time series and its lagged values after removing the effects of intermediate lags
  * Helps identify direct relationships between observations

* **Interpretation:**
  * Model order determination
  * Differentiating AR and MA processes
  * Identifying significant lag structures
  * Guiding forecasting model selection

* **Financial Applications:**
  * ARIMA model specification
  * Trading system design
  * Risk model development
  * Market microstructure analysis

## Special Characteristics of Financial Time Series

### Stylized Facts

* **Volatility Clustering:**
  * High volatility periods tend to cluster together
  * Leads to persistent autocorrelation in absolute/squared returns
  * Requires GARCH-type models for proper modeling

* **Fat Tails:**
  * Return distributions have excess kurtosis
  * Extreme events occur more frequently than normal distribution would predict
  * Requires consideration of tail risk in modeling

* **Leverage Effect:**
  * Negative returns tend to increase future volatility more than positive returns
  * Creates asymmetry in volatility response
  * Leads to skewed distributions

* **Long Memory:**
  * Autocorrelations decay slowly at long lags
  * Fractional integration may be present
  * Requires specialized modeling approaches

### Market Microstructure Effects

* **Bid-Ask Bounce:**
  * Trading between bid and ask prices creates artificial volatility
  * More prominent in high-frequency data
  * Requires filtering or appropriate sampling

* **Non-Synchronous Trading:**
  * Different assets trade at different times
  * Creates lead-lag relationships and correlation biases
  * Affects multivariate time series analysis

* **Intraday Patterns:**
  * U-shaped volatility patterns
  * Liquidity variations
  * Opening/closing auction effects
  * Requires time-of-day adjustments

## Exploratory Time Series Analysis

### Visualization Techniques

* **Time Series Plots:**
  * Line charts for price/return visualization
  * Candlestick charts for OHLC data
  * Volume overlays
  * Moving average visualization

* **Statistical Plots:**
  * ACF/PACF plots
  * QQ-plots for distribution analysis
  * Histogram and kernel density estimation
  * Rolling statistics visualization

* **Decomposition Visualization:**
  * Trend component plots
  * Seasonal component plots
  * Cyclical component plots
  * Residual analysis plots

### Preprocessing Approaches

* **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
  * Statistical detection methods
  * Domain-specific rules
  * Robust estimators
  * Treatment strategies (removal, winsorization, transformation)

* **Missing Data Handling:**
  * Forward/backward filling
  * Interpolation methods
  * Model-based imputation
  * Maximum likelihood approaches

* **Scaling and Normalization:**
  * Z-score standardization
  * Min-max scaling
  * Robust scaling
  * Rank-based normalization

## Related Concepts

* **Spectral Analysis:**
  * Fourier transforms
  * Periodograms
  * Spectral density estimation
  * Wavelets

* **Information Theory Metrics:**
  * Entropy measures
  * Mutual information
  * Transfer entropy
  * Relative entropy (KL divergence)

* **Complexity Measures:**
  * Hurst exponent
  * Approximate entropy
  * Sample entropy
  * Fractal dimension
