# Time Series Implementation Guide

> Best practices for implementing time series models in the VeritasVault platform

---

## Overview

This implementation guide provides a structured approach to deploying time series forecasting models within the VeritasVault platform. It covers the complete lifecycle from data preparation through deployment and monitoring, with a focus on financial applications.

## Guide Structure

This guide is organized into five key components:

1. **[Data Preparation](./implementation/ts-implementation-data.md)** - Techniques for preparing financial time series data
2. **[Model Selection](./implementation/ts-implementation-model-selection.md)** - Framework for choosing appropriate models
3. **[Training Pipeline](./implementation/ts-implementation-training.md)** - Building robust training workflows
4. **[Deployment](./implementation/ts-implementation-deployment.md)** - Moving models to production
5. **[Monitoring](./implementation/ts-implementation-monitoring.md)** - Ensuring continued model performance

## Key Principles

When implementing time series models at VeritasVault, adhere to these core principles:

1. **Data Integrity** - Ensure data completeness, correctness, and appropriate handling of outliers
2. **Temporal Validation** - Use time-based validation to prevent look-ahead bias
3. **Practical Robustness** - Optimize for stability across market regimes, not just in-sample performance
4. **Computational Efficiency** - Balance model sophistication with real-world performance requirements
5. **Interpretability** - Maintain appropriate levels of model transparency for financial applications

## Implementation Pathways

We recommend different implementation approaches based on use case complexity:

| Use Case | Recommended Path | Key Considerations |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Simple Univariate Forecasting | Classical methods → Gradient boosting | Low latency, interpretability |
| Multi-horizon Forecasting | Seq2Seq RNNs → Temporal Fusion Transformer | Balance accuracy vs. computational cost |
| High-frequency Prediction | TCN → Attention-enhanced RNNs | Data volume, processing pipeline efficiency |
| Volatility Forecasting | GARCH → LSTM-GARCH hybrids | Regime adaptation, tail risk capture |
| Multivariate Market Modeling | VAR → Neural state space models | Correlation preservation, system stability |

## Getting Started

For teams new to time series implementation at VeritasVault:

1. Begin with the [Data Preparation](./implementation/ts-implementation-data.md) guide
2. Review relevant [Model Selection](./implementation/ts-implementation-model-selection.md) criteria
3. Set up your [Training Pipeline](./implementation/ts-implementation-training.md)
4. Plan your [Deployment](./implementation/ts-implementation-deployment.md) strategy
5. Implement [Monitoring](./implementation/ts-implementation-monitoring.md) from day one
