## Monitoring Framework

### Key Monitoring Dimensions

* **Data Quality Monitoring**:
  * Input data completeness
  * Feature distribution stability
  * Missing value patterns
  * Outlier frequency

* **Model Performance Monitoring**:
  * Prediction accuracy metrics
  * Financial performance metrics
  * Confidence calibration
  * Error distribution

* **Operational Monitoring**:
  * System health metrics
  * Resource utilization
  * Throughput and latency
  * Error rates and exceptions

* **Business Impact Monitoring**:
  * Financial impact metrics
  * Decision quality metrics
  * Opportunity cost analysis
  * Comparative performance

### Monitoring Frequency

| Frequency | Use Cases | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Real-time | Trading systems | Streaming analytics |
|           | Anomaly detection | In-memory tracking |
|           | Critical risk systems | Push notifications |
| Near real-time | Intraday risk | Micro-batch processing |
|               | Market monitoring | Short-interval dashboards |
|               | Limit breach detection | Alert systems |
| Daily | Portfolio analytics | Overnight batch jobs |
|       | Strategy performance | Daily reports |
|       | Model retraining decisions | Scheduled evaluations |
| Weekly/Monthly | Long-term drift analysis | Aggregated reports |
|                | Comprehensive model review | Review meetings |
|                | Governance requirements | Compliance documentation |

## Monitoring Approaches

### Proactive Monitoring

* **Scheduled Health Checks**:
  * Regular validation against reference datasets
  * Automated backtesting on recent data
  * Benchmark comparison reports
  * Feature stability assessments

* **Synthetic Transaction Monitoring**:
  * Known-result test cases
  * Boundary condition testing
  * Extreme value testing
  * Consistency checks

* **Pre-deployment Safeguards**:
  * Shadow deployment phase
  * A/B testing framework
  * Canary releases
  * Progressive rollout

### Reactive Monitoring

* **Real-time Alerting**:
  * Threshold-based alerts
  * Anomaly detection
  * Compound alert conditions
  * Alert prioritization

* **Incident Response**:
  * Automated failover
  * Fallback model activation
  * Circuit breaker patterns
  * Manual intervention triggers

* **Post-incident Analysis**:
  * Root cause determination
  * Impact assessment
  * Remediation planning
  * Recurrence prevention

  * Cost/benefit analysis
  * Risk exposure calculation

## Implementation Overview

To implement a comprehensive monitoring system for time series models:

1. Define monitoring requirements based on model criticality and use case
2. Design appropriate monitoring architecture with required components
3. Implement drift detection mechanisms (see [Drift Detection Guide](./ts-implementation-monitoring-drift.md))
4. Establish performance evaluation framework (see [Performance Evaluation Guide](./ts-implementation-monitoring-performance.md))
5. Configure alert systems and response procedures (see [Alert Systems Guide](./ts-implementation-monitoring-alerts.md))
6. Develop continuous improvement processes (see [Continuous Improvement Guide](./ts-implementation-monitoring-improvement.md))
