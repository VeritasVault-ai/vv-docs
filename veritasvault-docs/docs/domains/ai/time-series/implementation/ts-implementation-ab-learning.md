  * Confidence interval calculation
  * Effect size estimation
  * Multiple testing correction

### Integration Points

* **Serving Layer Integration**:
  * Request routing mechanisms
  * Model version selection
  * Result labeling
  * Performance logging

* **Monitoring Integration**:
  * Real-time performance dashboards
  * Automatic stoppage rules
  * Alert integration
  * Drift detection coordination

* **Business Systems Integration**:
  * Decision outcome tracking
  * Business KPI measurement
  * ROI calculation
  * Impact assessment

## Implementation Guidance

### Test Configuration

When setting up A/B tests for time series models, consider:

1. **Test Duration**:
   * Must be long enough to capture seasonal patterns
   * Should span multiple business cycles if applicable
   * Need to account for delayed outcomes/ground truth

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   * Entity-level assignment (customer, security, etc.) for consistency
   * Time-based allocation for some use cases
   * Consider market conditions during allocation

3. **Metric Selection**:
   * Primary metrics tied to business objectives
   * Secondary metrics for comprehensive assessment
   * Guardrail metrics to prevent negative outcomes
   * Leading indicators for early signals

### Statistical Framework

For proper evaluation of time series models:

1. **Appropriate Test Selection**:
   * Consider autocorrelation in time series data
   * Use block bootstrap for statistical testing
   * Adjust degrees of freedom for time series dependency
   * Apply multiple testing correction for many metrics

2. **Sample Size Determination**:
   * Power analysis accounting for time series characteristics
   * Minimum detectable effect based on business requirements
   * Variability assessment using historical data
   * Consideration of varying market regimes

3. **Phased Evaluation**:
   * Initial shadow testing phase
   * Limited exposure phase
   * Full test phase
   * Extended validation phase

## Implementation Examples

Detailed implementation examples for A/B testing frameworks will be provided in future updates.

## Best Practices

* **Isolate Test Effects**:
  * Ensure clean separation between test groups
  * Avoid contamination through dependent systems
  * Control for external factors and market conditions
  * Document all concurrent changes

* **Guard Against False Conclusions**:
  * Set stopping rules in advance
  * Avoid peeking at results too frequently
  * Use appropriate correction for multiple testing
  * Document all tested hypotheses

* **Document Everything**:
  * Test design and hypotheses
  * Implementation details
  * Statistical analysis plan
  * Results and conclusions
