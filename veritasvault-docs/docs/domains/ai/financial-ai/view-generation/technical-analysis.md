# Technical Analysis View Generation

> AI-enhanced technical analysis for market prediction

---

## Overview

This document outlines VeritasVault's approach to generating investment views through AI-enhanced technical analysis. Our systems combine traditional technical indicators with advanced machine learning to identify patterns and generate probabilistic forecasts across multiple time horizons.

## Technical Indicators and Features

### Price Action Analysis

* Candlestick pattern recognition
* Support and resistance identification
* Chart pattern detection (head and shoulders, triangles, etc.)
* Volume-price relationship analysis

### Momentum Indicators

* RSI (Relative Strength Index) with adaptive parameters
* MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
* Stochastic oscillators
* Rate of change analysis

### Volatility Measures

* Bollinger Bands with dynamic width adjustment
* ATR (Average True Range) forecasting
* VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price) analysis
* Volatility regime detection

### Market Structure

* Market breadth indicators
* Sectoral rotation analysis
* Intermarket relationships
* Liquidity metrics

## Machine Learning Enhancements

### Pattern Recognition

```python
# Example of CNN-based pattern recognition for technical analysis
def create_pattern_recognition_model(lookback_window=60, n_patterns=12):
    from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
    from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Dense, Flatten
    
    # Input layer for price sequences
    inputs = Input(shape=(lookback_window, 5))  # OHLCV data
    
    # Convolutional layers for pattern detection
    x = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(x)
    x = Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(x)
    x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(x)
    x = Conv1D(filters=256, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(x)
    x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(x)
    
    # Classification layers
    x = Flatten()(x)
    x = Dense(100, activation='relu')(x)
    outputs = Dense(n_patterns, activation='softmax')(x)
    
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    model.compile(
        optimizer='adam',
        loss='categorical_crossentropy',
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )
    
    return model
```

### Time Series Forecasting

* Attention mechanisms for relevant feature weighting
* Wavelet transforms for multi-frequency analysis
* Transformer models for sequence modeling

### Anomaly Detection

* Autoencoder-based market anomaly identification
* Statistical outlier detection
* Regime change detection
* Volatility clustering analysis

### Ensemble Approaches

* Boosting algorithms for indicator combination
* Random forest for decision boundary identification

   * Normalization and standardization
   * Feature engineering
   * Temporal aggregation

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   * Historical pattern matching
   * Significance testing
   * Context-aware pattern evaluation
   * Probability assignment

3. **Forecast Generation**
