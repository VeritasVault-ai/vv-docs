# NLP for Market Sentiment

> Natural Language Processing techniques for financial sentiment analysis

---

## Overview

This document outlines how VeritasVault leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text-based data sources and extract sentiment signals for investment view generation. Our systems process vast amounts of textual information to identify market sentiment, company perception, and emerging narratives that can impact asset prices.

## Text Data Sources

### Corporate Communications

* Earnings call transcripts
* Annual reports and SEC filings
* Press releases and corporate blogs
* Management presentations

### Financial News and Analysis

* Financial news articles
* Analyst reports
* Expert commentaries
* Industry publications

### Social Media and Web Content

* Social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)
* Financial forums and discussion boards
* Investment blogs
* Consumer review platforms

### Regulatory Documentation

* Central bank communications
* Regulatory announcements
* Policy documents
* Legal proceedings

## NLP Techniques

### Sentiment Analysis

```python
# Example of financial sentiment analysis using transformer models
def analyze_earnings_call_sentiment(transcript_text):
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
    import torch
    import numpy as np
    
    # Load finance-tuned BERT model
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("financial/finbert-sentiment")
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("financial/finbert-sentiment")
    
    # Process by paragraphs to handle long transcripts
    paragraphs = split_into_paragraphs(transcript_text)
    
    sentiment_scores = []
    key_segments = []
    
    for i, paragraph in enumerate(paragraphs):
        # Tokenize and predict
        inputs = tokenizer(paragraph, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(**inputs)
        
        # Get prediction (positive, negative, neutral)
        scores = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]
        sentiment_scores.append({
            'positive': float(scores[0]),
            'negative': float(scores[1]),
            'neutral': float(scores[2]),
            'paragraph_idx': i
        })
        
        # Capture highly positive/negative segments for explanation
        if scores[0] > 0.7 or scores[1] > 0.7:
            key_segments.append({
                'text': paragraph,
                'sentiment': 'positive' if scores[0] > scores[1] else 'negative',
                'score': float(max(scores[0], scores[1])),
                'paragraph_idx': i
            })
    
    # Aggregate results
    avg_sentiment = {
        'positive': np.mean([s['positive'] for s in sentiment_scores]),
        'negative': np.mean([s['negative'] for s in sentiment_scores]),
        'neutral': np.mean([s['neutral'] for s in sentiment_scores])
    }
    
    # Calculate composite score (-1 to +1)
    composite_score = avg_sentiment['positive'] - avg_sentiment['negative']
    
    return {
        'composite_score': composite_score,
        'detailed_sentiment': avg_sentiment,
        'key_segments': sorted(key_segments, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)[:10]
    }
```
