# Alternative Data Processing

> Leveraging non-traditional data sources for investment insights

---

## Overview

This document outlines how VeritasVault processes and analyzes alternative data sources to generate unique investment views. Alternative data refers to non-traditional information sources that can provide novel insights into company performance, market trends, and economic conditions beyond what is available in conventional financial data.

## Alternative Data Types

### Digital Footprint Data

* Website and mobile app traffic
* Search trend analysis
* Social media engagement metrics
* Digital product adoption rates

### Consumer Activity

* Credit card transaction data
* Point-of-sale system data
* Consumer sentiment surveys
* Loyalty program analytics

### Business Operations

* Satellite imagery analysis
* IoT sensor data
* Supply chain monitoring
* Employment listings and workforce dynamics

### Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

* Carbon emissions data
* Labor practices information
* Corporate governance metrics
* Regulatory compliance tracking

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Acquisition

* Vendor selection and evaluation
* Data quality assessment
* Sampling strategy optimization
* Refresh frequency management

### Pre-processing

```python
# Example of satellite imagery pre-processing for retail parking lot analysis
def preprocess_satellite_imagery(image_data, location_metadata):
    from skimage import io, transform, filters, feature
    import numpy as np
    
    # Image normalization and enhancement
    normalized = image_data / 255.0
    enhanced = filters.unsharp_mask(normalized, radius=2, amount=1.5)
    
    # Segmentation for parking lot detection
    segmented = segment_parking_areas(enhanced, location_metadata)
    
    # Vehicle detection using pretrained model
    vehicle_count, occupancy_rate = detect_vehicles(segmented)
    
    # Historical comparison
    yoy_change = calculate_yoy_change(location_metadata['store_id'], 
                                      occupancy_rate)
    
    return {
        'store_id': location_metadata['store_id'],
        'timestamp': location_metadata['timestamp'],
        'vehicle_count': vehicle_count,
        'occupancy_rate': occupancy_rate,
        'yoy_change': yoy_change
    }
```

### Feature Extraction
