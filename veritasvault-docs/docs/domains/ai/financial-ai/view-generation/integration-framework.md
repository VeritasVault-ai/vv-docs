# View Integration Framework

> Systematic approach for combining multiple investment views

---

## Overview

This document outlines VeritasVault's framework for integrating investment views from multiple sources into a coherent set of inputs for portfolio optimization. The integration framework ensures that views generated through different methodologies are properly weighted, normalized, and combined while accounting for correlations and confidence levels.

## Integration Challenges

* View consistency across methodologies
* Conflicting signals reconciliation
* Appropriate confidence weighting
* Time horizon alignment
* Dimensional consistency

## Integration Architecture

### View Data Structure

* Standardized view format
* Required metadata fields
* Confidence metrics
* Source attribution

### Integration Pipeline

```python
# Example of view integration pipeline
def integrate_investment_views(fundamental_views, technical_views, 
                              alternative_data_views, nlp_views,
                              integration_config):
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Standardize view formats
    std_views = {
        'fundamental': standardize_views(fundamental_views),
        'technical': standardize_views(technical_views),
        'alt_data': standardize_views(alternative_data_views),
        'nlp': standardize_views(nlp_views)
    }
    
    # Apply source-specific adjustments
    for source, views in std_views.items():
        confidence_calibration = integration_config['calibration'][source]
        std_views[source] = apply_calibration(views, confidence_calibration)
    
    # Identify and resolve conflicts
    conflict_resolution = detect_and_resolve_conflicts(std_views, 
                                                      integration_config['conflict_threshold'])
    
    # Perform view aggregation
    if integration_config['method'] == 'weighted_average':
        aggregated_views = weighted_average_aggregation(std_views, 
                                                       integration_config['weights'])
    elif integration_config['method'] == 'bayesian':
        aggregated_views = bayesian_view_aggregation(std_views)
    elif integration_config['method'] == 'ensemble':
        aggregated_views = ensemble_aggregation(std_views)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown integration method: {integration_config['method']}")
    
    # Normalize and format for portfolio optimization
    final_views = format_for_optimization(aggregated_views, 
                                         integration_config['optimization_target'])
    
    # Generate diagnostics and explanation data
    diagnostics = generate_integration_diagnostics(std_views, aggregated_views, 
                                                  conflict_resolution)
    
    return final_views, diagnostics
```
