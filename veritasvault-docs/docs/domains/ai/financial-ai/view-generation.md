# View Generation

> AI-powered investment view generation for portfolio construction

---

## Overview

This document outlines the AI-enhanced view generation techniques implemented within the VeritasVault platform. Investment views represent forward-looking opinions about asset returns, volatilities, and correlations that can be integrated into portfolio construction processes, particularly within frameworks like Black-Litterman.

## What Are Investment Views?

Investment views are quantitative or qualitative predictions about future market behavior that can be transformed into specific inputs for portfolio optimization. Views typically include:

* Expected returns for individual assets or asset classes
* Relative performance expectations between assets
* Volatility projections
* Correlation shifts
* Market regime predictions

## AI-Enhanced View Generation

Traditional view generation relies heavily on analyst expertise and manual processes. Our AI-enhanced approach systematizes and augments this process through:

* [Fundamental Analysis View Generation](./view-generation/fundamental-analysis.md)
* [Technical Analysis View Generation](./view-generation/technical-analysis.md)
* [Alternative Data Processing](./view-generation/alternative-data.md)
* [NLP for Market Sentiment](./view-generation/nlp-sentiment.md)
* [Confidence Calibration](./view-generation/confidence-calibration.md)

## Integration with Portfolio Optimization

Views generated through our AI systems are carefully calibrated and integrated into portfolio optimization processes:

* Black-Litterman model integration
* View weighting and confidence metrics
* Consistency checking
* Temporal view adjustment
* View diversity analysis

See [View Integration Framework](./view-generation/integration-framework.md) for implementation details.

## Governance and Validation

All generated views undergo rigorous validation before being considered for portfolio decisions:

* Historical accuracy assessment
* Logical consistency verification
* Domain expert review process
* Confidence scoring
* See [View Governance](./view-generation/governance.md) for complete protocols
