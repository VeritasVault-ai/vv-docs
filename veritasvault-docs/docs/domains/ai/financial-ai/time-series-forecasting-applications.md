## Implementation Examples

### Equity Market Example

```python
# Simplified example of an LSTM-based equity forecaster
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

def create_equity_forecaster(lookback_window, feature_count):
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(lookback_window, feature_count)),
        Dropout(0.2),
        LSTM(32),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(16, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1)  # Output: next period return prediction
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
    return model

# Usage
lookback = 30  # 30 days of history
features = 15  # Technical, fundamental, and market features
model = create_equity_forecaster(lookback, features)
```

### Volatility Forecasting Example

```python
# Simplified example of a volatility forecaster with regime detection
import numpy as np
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_regime_aware_volatility_model(lookback, features):
    # Regime detection component
    regime_inputs = Input(shape=(lookback, features))
    regime_lstm = LSTM(32)(regime_inputs)
    regime_output = Dense(3, activation='softmax')(regime_lstm)  # 3 regimes
    
    # Volatility forecasting component
    vol_inputs = Input(shape=(lookback, features))
    vol_lstm = LSTM(64)(vol_inputs)
    
    # Combine regime awareness with volatility prediction
    combined = Concatenate()([vol_lstm, regime_output])
    dense = Dense(32, activation='relu')(combined)
    vol_output = Dense(1, activation='relu')(dense)  # Positive volatility output
    
    model = Model(inputs=[regime_inputs, vol_inputs], outputs=[regime_output, vol_output])
    
    # Custom loss function can weight regime accuracy and volatility prediction
    return model
```

### Regime Detection Example

```python
# Simplified regime detection using Hidden Markov Models
from hmmlearn import hmm
import numpy as np

class MarketRegimeDetector:
    def __init__(self, n_regimes=3):
        self.model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=n_regimes, covariance_type="full")
        self.n_regimes = n_regimes
        
    def fit(self, returns, volatility, features):
        # Combine returns, volatility and other features
        X = np.column_stack([returns, volatility, features])
        self.model.fit(X)
        return self
        
    def predict_regime(self, returns, volatility, features):
        X = np.column_stack([returns, volatility, features])
        return self.model.predict(X)
        
    def regime_probabilities(self, returns, volatility, features):
        X = np.column_stack([returns, volatility, features])
