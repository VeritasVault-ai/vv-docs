# AI Architecture

> Secure, auditable, and regulatory-compliant AI infrastructure for VeritasVault

---

## Overview

The AI Architecture of VeritasVault provides the foundational infrastructure for deploying, managing, and governing AI/ML models within a highly regulated and security-conscious environment. This architecture ensures all models are fully auditable, rollback-tested, and comply with regulatory requirements while delivering advanced analytics and trading capabilities.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into multiple sections for easier navigation and maintenance:

1. **[AI Architecture Overview](./ai-architecture-overview.md)**
   - Core principles and architectural vision
   - Key requirements and constraints
   - High-level architectural patterns

2. **[AI Architecture Components](./ai-architecture-components.md)**
   - Detailed component descriptions
   - Interaction patterns and data flows
   - Security and resilience mechanisms

3. **[AI Architecture Implementation](./ai-architecture-implementation.md)**
   - Technical implementation details
   - Technology stack selections
   - Deployment considerations

4. **[AI Architecture Reference](./ai-architecture-reference.md)**
   - Security considerations
   - Compliance mappings
   - External references and standards

## Key Features

* **Auditability & Traceability**: Every model, parameter change, and inference is cryptographically signed and traceable
* **Atomic Versioning**: Complete version histories with guaranteed atomic updates and rollbacks
* **Security by Design**: Zero trust architecture with comprehensive security controls
* **Compliance Gates**: Automated regulatory compliance checks integrated into deployment pipelines
* **Fairness Monitoring**: Continuous bias and fairness monitoring with automated intervention
* **Decentralized Governance**: Distributed operator model with economic security mechanisms
