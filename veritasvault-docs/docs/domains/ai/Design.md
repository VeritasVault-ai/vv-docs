## 2. Executive Summary

### Business Impact

* Delivers auditable, secure, and compliant AI/ML infrastructure to power DeFi protocols—no black boxes, no untraceable logic.
* Enables real-time analytics, risk mitigation, and advanced trading features—**with provable, roll-backable guarantees**.
* Mandatory for institutional onboarding, regulatory acceptance, and sustained innovation.

### Technical Impact

* Centralizes model registry, deployment, and atomic version control for all AI/ML models—**every artifact and dependency cryptographically proven**.
* Security enforcement (incident, rollback, circuit breaker) is enforced at every deploy—**zero trust by default**.
* Automated, auditable compliance reporting and fairness monitoring; integration with protocol governance for operator onboarding and staking.

### Timeline Impact

* **Phase 1 MVP:** GlobalModelRegistry and SecurityController (model registration, versioning, and incident detection—all atomic, roll-back tested).
* **Phase 2:** ModelDeploymentController, shadow/canary/prod pipelines, backtesting, and bias/fairness monitoring (auto-block on violations).
* **Phase 3:** Governance, operator onboarding, and regulatory reporting (compliance gates block all non-compliant deploys).
* **Phase 4:** OperatorStakingController and full-scale, decentralized, economically secured production launch.

## 3. Domain Overview

The AI/ML domain is the intelligence backbone of VeritasVault—**explicitly engineered for hostile and high-regulatory environments**. Security, auditability, and regulatory compliance are design-first, not afterthoughts.

---

## 4. Responsibilities & Boundaries

### Core Functions

* Model lifecycle management (registration, update, atomic versioning, promotion)
* Incident detection, automated rollback, and security policy enforcement (rollback playbooks and test automation required)
* Bias/fairness monitoring and response (intersectional, group, and temporal bias, not just summary stats)
* Operator onboarding, staking, cartel detection (on-chain traceability for all events)
* Automated regulatory and compliance reporting—**compliance as a hard gate**

### Scope Definition

* **In Scope:**

  * GlobalModelRegistry, SecurityController, ModelDeploymentController, ContinuousFairnessController, GovernanceController (AI), RegulatoryReportingController, OperatorStakingController
* **Out of Scope:**

  * ML model implementation specifics, raw data acquisition pipelines, user-facing analytics dashboards

---

## 5. Domain Model Structure (DDD)

### Aggregate Roots

* **ModelMetadata:** All model artifacts, metadata, version, and lifecycle state. Provenance and dependency tracked.
* **IncidentReport:** Security incidents, escalation, and rollback records. All immutable and auditable.
* **FairnessConfig:** Bias metrics, drift detection, auto-response—**audit trails for all fairness events**.
* **OperatorStake:** Operator registration, staking, cartel prevention—**all on-chain and cryptographically signed**.

### Entities

* **ShadowDeployment:** Shadow/canary/prod deployments; only promoted if passing all fairness and security gates.
* **BacktestResult:** Backtesting and simulation data, linked to deployed version.
* **SlashingEvent:** All punitive events fully reproducible with evidence.
* **ComplianceReport:** Regulatory/attestation events, exportable and immutable.

### Value Objects

* **ModelIdentifier:** Unique ID/version for models (cryptographically signed).
* **BiasMetric:** Immutable record of fairness/bias scores, provenance included.
* **DeploymentPhase:** Enum for deployment lifecycle state.

### Domain Events

* **ModelRegistered, DeploymentStatusChanged, IncidentReported, FairnessViolation, OperatorSlashed:** All events signed, timestamped, hash-proven.

### Repository Contracts

* **IModelRepository:** Track/manage all model artifacts and versions—atomic updates, explicit rollbacks.
* **IIncidentReportRepository:** Store and retrieve incident reports, audit trails.
* **IFairnessConfigRepository:** Manage fairness/bias/drift configs, evidence chain.
* **IOperatorStakeRepository:** All operator records, slashing, delegation, and cartel detection.
* **IComplianceReportRepository:** All compliance reporting and export, with cryptographic proofs.

### Invariants / Business Rules

* **No model deployed** without passing all security, fairness, and compliance gates.
* **All incidents** require review, rollback/circuit breaker, and immutable audit record.
* **No operator onboarding** without stake, regulatory check, cartel prevention logic, and KYC.
* **All regulatory reports** cryptographically signed and auditable—**no manual overrides**.

## Implementation Strategy: Phased Delivery (With Best Practices Baked In)

### Phase 1 – Foundation & Model Security (MVP)

* GlobalModelRegistry: Model registration, versioning, dependency graph—**all atomic and rollback tested**
* SecurityController: Incident detection, circuit breaker, cryptographic validation
* **Deliverable:** Working MVP with provable, secure model onboarding (no partial deploys allowed)

### Phase 2 – Deployment & Fairness

* ModelDeploymentController: Shadow/canary/prod flows; promotion blocked unless all fairness/security gates passed
* ContinuousFairnessController: Bias/drift monitoring, auto-response triggers, audit trails
* **Deliverable:** Production pipeline with **automated bias controls, rollback, and monitoring**

### Phase 3 – Governance & Compliance

* GovernanceController (AI): Operator onboarding, diversity tracking, audit logs (geo and stake diversity required)
* RegulatoryReportingController: Regulatory reporting, attestation management, cryptographic export
* **Deliverable:** Institutional-grade governance and compliance—**all events traceable and signed**

### Phase 4 – Operator Staking & Production

* OperatorStakingController: Staking, deterministic slashing, cartel prevention (all events on-chain)
* **Deliverable:** Fully decentralized, economically secured production deployment

## Operations Guide (Per Phase)

* Dashboard monitoring: Registry, incidents, fairness, operator events, compliance
* Security alerting and incident response: Runbooks for rollback/circuit breaker, tested each release
* Regulatory report tracking and cryptographic export
* Stake, slashing, and cartel event monitoring (geo and stake concentration alerts)

---

## Resource Planning (Per Phase)

* Validator nodes, storage, network capacity: Geo-redundancy and failover tested
* Data science/AI ops team ramp-up with compliance and security champions
* Compliance and audit ops: Automated and manual
* Cost forecasting for compute, storage, audits, and incident response

---

## Risk & Compliance (Ongoing, Per Phase)

* Risk assessment and mitigation updated for new threats **per phase**
* Compliance mapped to release gates; deploys blocked on non-compliance
* Threat models updated with every new integration or operator

---

## Quality Assurance (Across Phases)

* Unit, integration, and system test targets: 80%+ coverage, fail pipeline below threshold
* Penetration testing for security, rollback, incident flows, and fairness gates
* Fairness, drift, and bias validation suites—intersectional and temporal
* Audit trail review and automated reporting checks

---

## Integration Guide

* Dependency list: All core infra, risk/compliance, and governance mapped to explicit interface contracts
* API contracts: All onboarding, incident, operator management, and compliance events versioned and signed
* Integration tests: Cross-domain scenarios with rollback drills and compliance replays
