# AI Model Governance Framework

> Comprehensive governance system for AI models in a regulated financial environment

---

## 1. Overview

The Model Governance Framework establishes the standards, processes, and controls necessary to ensure AI models within VeritasVault operate in a secure, fair, transparent, and compliant manner. This framework addresses the unique challenges of governing AI systems in decentralized financial infrastructure where traditional governance approaches are insufficient. It creates a robust foundation for institutional-grade AI operations with cryptographic guarantees, economic incentives, and regulatory compliance built-in.

## 2. Governance Principles

### Transparency & Accountability

* **Complete Traceability:** All model development, deployment, and operations decisions have clear ownership
* **Immutable Audit Trails:** Cryptographically secured records of all governance activities
* **Explainability Requirements:** Every model decision can be appropriately explained
* **Responsibility Mapping:** Clear ownership for each aspect of model governance

### Risk-Based Governance

* **Model Risk Classification:** Tiered approach based on potential impact
* **Proportionate Controls:** Governance intensity matched to risk level
* **Ongoing Risk Assessment:** Continuous re-evaluation as models and context evolve
* **Comprehensive Risk Coverage:** Technical, operational, financial, and reputational risks

### Decentralized Control

* **Multi-Party Governance:** No single entity controls critical decisions
* **Operator Diversity:** Geographic and organizational diversity requirements
* **Economic Security:** Financial stake required for governance participation
* **Anti-Cartelization Measures:** Prevents collusion and centralization of control

### Regulatory Alignment

* **Compliance by Design:** Governance processes aligned with regulatory expectations
* **Jurisdiction-Aware Controls:** Adapts to regulatory requirements across geographies
* **Evidence Generation:** Automated collection of compliance artifacts
* **Regulatory Evolution:** Framework designed to adapt to changing requirements
