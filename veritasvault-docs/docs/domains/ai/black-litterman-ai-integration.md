# Black-Litterman AI Integration

> AI-enhanced portfolio optimization using the Black-Litterman framework

---

## Overview

The Black-Litterman AI Integration combines advanced artificial intelligence techniques with the Black-Litterman portfolio optimization model to create a more robust, responsive, and accurate asset allocation framework. This integration leverages machine learning to enhance key components of the Black-Litterman model, including improved parameter estimation, intelligent view generation, and adaptive covariance modeling.
