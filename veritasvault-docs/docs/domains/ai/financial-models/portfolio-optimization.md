# Portfolio Optimization Framework

> Comprehensive framework for portfolio construction and optimization

---

## 1. Overview

The Portfolio Optimization Framework provides a unified infrastructure for constructing and optimizing investment portfolios within the VeritasVault platform. It supports multiple optimization methodologies, including traditional mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman approach, risk parity, and factor-based allocation strategies. This document outlines the architecture, components, and integration points of the framework.

## 2. Architecture

### Core Components

* **OptimizationEngine:** Central service for executing optimization algorithms
* **ObjectiveFactory:** Creates objective functions based on optimization goals
* **ConstraintBuilder:** Constructs and validates portfolio constraints
* **SolverManager:** Selects and configures appropriate numerical solvers
* **SolutionValidator:** Verifies optimization results against constraints
* **ResultInterpreter:** Provides analysis and visualization of optimization outputs

### Data Flow

1. **Input Collection:** Gather expected returns, covariance, constraints
2. **Problem Formulation:** Construct mathematical optimization problem
3. **Solver Selection:** Choose appropriate numerical solver
4. **Execution:** Run optimization algorithm
5. **Validation:** Verify solution meets constraints
6. **Interpretation:** Analyze and visualize results
7. **Implementation:** Convert to executable trades or allocation changes

## 3. Optimization Methodologies

### Mean-Variance Optimization

* **Objective Functions:**
  * Maximum Sharpe ratio
  * Minimum variance
  * Maximum return for given risk
  * Minimum risk for given return
  * Maximum utility (risk-adjusted return)

* **Formulation:**
  * w* = argmin_w (w'Σw - λw'μ)
  * Subject to constraints (Aw ≤ b, Cw = d)

### Black-Litterman Approach

* **Integration Points:**
  * Market equilibrium calculation
  * View integration
  * Posterior distribution computation
  * Optimal allocation determination

* **Implementation:**
  * See [Black-Litterman Model](../FinancialModels/BlackLitterman.md) for details

### Risk Parity

* **Equal Risk Contribution:**
  * Each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk
  * w_i(Σw)_i = w_j(Σw)_j for all i,j

* **Risk Budgeting:**
  * Asset risk contribution proportional to specified budget
  * w_i(Σw)_i = b_i * σ_p^2

### Factor-Based Allocation

* **Factor Exposure Targeting:**
  * Optimize to achieve specific factor exposures
  * Target tracking error to factor benchmarks

* **Factor Risk Parity:**
  * Equal risk contribution from each factor
  * Considers factor covariance structure

## 4. Constraint Framework

### Constraint Types

* **Basic Constraints:**
  * Long-only (w_i ≥ 0)
  * Full investment (Σw_i = 1)
  * No leverage (Σ|w_i| ≤ 1)
  * Position limits (l_i ≤ w_i ≤ u_i)

* **Group Constraints:**
  * Sector/industry limits
  * Country/region allocation
  * Asset class boundaries
  * Factor exposure limits

* **Risk Constraints:**
  * Volatility ceiling
  * Tracking error limits
  * VaR/CVaR constraints
  * Drawdown limitations

* **Turnover Constraints:**
  * Transaction cost control
  * Maximum position changes
  * Staged implementation paths

### Constraint Representation

* **Linear Constraints:** Ax ≤ b, Cx = d
* **Quadratic Constraints:** x'Qx + q'x ≤ r
* **Nonlinear Constraints:** g(x) ≤ 0, h(x) = 0

## 5. Solver Infrastructure

### Solver Types

* **Quadratic Programming:**
  * For mean-variance with linear constraints
  * OSQP, quadprog, CPLEX, Gurobi

* **Second-Order Cone Programming:**
  * For problems with norm constraints
  * ECOS, SCS, MOSEK

* **Nonlinear Programming:**
  * For complex objective functions
  * IPOPT, SLSQP, L-BFGS-B

* **Custom Solvers:**
  * For specific formulations (e.g., risk parity)
  * Cyclical coordinate descent, alternating optimization

### Solver Selection Logic

* Based on problem characteristics
* Optimization goal
* Constraint types
* Problem size
* Required accuracy
