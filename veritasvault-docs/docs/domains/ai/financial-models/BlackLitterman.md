# Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization Model

> Advanced asset allocation framework integrating market equilibrium with investor views

---

## Overview

The Black-Litterman model is an advanced portfolio optimization framework that extends traditional mean-variance optimization by combining market equilibrium expected returns with investor-specific views. This implementation provides a robust, secure, and auditable way to optimize portfolio allocation across the VeritasVault platform.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into multiple sections for easier navigation and maintenance:

1. **[Black-Litterman Overview](./BlackLitterman-Overview.md)**
   - Core concepts and theoretical foundation
   - Market equilibrium, investor views, and combined estimation

2. **[Black-Litterman Implementation](./BlackLitterman-Implementation.md)**
   - Technical implementation details
   - Mathematical framework and formulas
   - Key parameters and constraints

3. **[Black-Litterman Integration](./BlackLitterman-Integration.md)**
   - Integration with VeritasVault domains
   - Implementation phases and roadmap

4. **[Black-Litterman Reference](./BlackLitterman-Reference.md)**
   - Security and compliance considerations
   - References and further reading
   - Sample implementation examples

## Key Benefits

* Combines market equilibrium with subjective views
* Handles uncertainty in investor beliefs
* Produces more stable and intuitive portfolio allocations
* Reduces extreme allocations common in traditional optimization
* Provides flexible framework for incorporating diverse investment insights
