# Black-Litterman Portfolio Optimization Model: Integration

> Integration with VeritasVault domains and implementation strategy

---

## 5. Integration with VeritasVault Domains

### Core Infrastructure

* Utilizes TimeSeriesStore for efficient storage and retrieval of historical returns
* Leverages ComputeOrchestrator for matrix operations and optimization calculations
* Implements event sourcing for all model updates and parameter changes

### Asset, Trading & Settlement

* Provides optimal portfolio weights to guide asset allocation
* Supports market capitalization weighted indices as reference portfolios
* Enables portfolio rebalancing based on updated model outputs

### Governance, Ops & Custody

* Model parameters undergo formal governance approval workflows
* Parameter changes are tracked with immutable audit trails
* Portfolio constraints are managed through governance controls

### Risk, Compliance & Audit

* Portfolio risk characteristics are monitored in real-time
* Model outputs undergo validation against compliance constraints
* Stress testing evaluates model performance under adverse scenarios
* Backtesting provides historical performance validation

### AI/ML Domain

* AI-enhanced covariance estimation improves model stability
* Machine learning assists in view generation and confidence calibration
* Anomaly detection identifies potential issues in model inputs or outputs

### External Interface Domain

* Interactive visualization of efficient frontier
* Tools for specifying and adjusting investor views
* Confidence level adjustment interfaces
* Clear communication of risk and expected returns

## 6. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

* Basic Black-Litterman model with market capitalization weighting
* Manual view specification and basic constraints
* Initial integration with portfolio management

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities

* Robust covariance estimation methods
* Advanced constraint framework
* View confidence calibration tools
* Parameter governance workflows

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

* AI-enhanced parameter estimation
* Scenario analysis and stress testing
* Factor and ESG integration
* Full backtesting framework

### Phase 4: Enterprise Scale

* Multi-asset class extension
* Real-time optimization updates
* Custom constraint builder
* Institutional-grade governance controls
