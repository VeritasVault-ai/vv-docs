# AI Architecture: Components

> Detailed component architecture for VeritasVault's AI infrastructure

---

## Overview

The AI Architecture for VeritasVault consists of specialized components organized into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities and interaction patterns. This documentation provides detailed information about each component, its responsibilities, interfaces, and how it contributes to the overall architectural goals of security, auditability, and regulatory compliance.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into specialized sections for each architectural layer:

1. **[Infrastructure Layer Components](./components/ai-components-infrastructure.md)**
   - Compute resources 
   - Storage systems
   - Network infrastructure
   - Identity and access management

2. **[Core Services Layer Components](./components/ai-components-core.md)**
   - Model registry
   - Event store
   - Security services
   - Deployment services

3. **[Domain Services Layer Components](./components/ai-components-domain.md)**
   - Lifecycle management
   - Fairness monitoring
   - Compliance services
   - Governance services

4. **[Integration Layer Components](./components/ai-components-integration.md)**
   - API gateway
   - Event bus
   - Data integration
   - External services

5. **[Client Layer Components](./components/ai-components-client.md)**
   - Management interfaces
   - Monitoring dashboards
   - Reporting tools
   - Developer tools

## Key Component Categories

### Controllers

Controllers are the primary entry points for interacting with the AI domain:

* **GlobalModelRegistryController:** Manages model registration and versioning
* **SecurityController:** Handles security incidents and policy enforcement
* **ModelDeploymentController:** Controls model deployment lifecycle
* **ContinuousFairnessController:** Monitors and enforces fairness requirements
* **GovernanceController:** Manages operator onboarding and oversight
* **RegulatoryReportingController:** Generates compliance documentation
* **OperatorStakingController:** Manages economic security mechanisms

### Repositories

Repositories provide persistent storage and retrieval capabilities:

* **ModelRepository:** Stores model metadata and artifacts
* **IncidentReportRepository:** Records security incidents and responses
* **FairnessConfigRepository:** Manages fairness configuration and metrics
* **OperatorStakeRepository:** Tracks operator stake and activities
* **ComplianceReportRepository:** Stores regulatory compliance data

### Services

Services implement the core business logic:

* **ModelVersioningService:** Manages atomic versioning and dependencies
* **DeploymentOrchestrationService:** Controls the deployment pipeline
* **BiasDetectionService:** Analyzes models for bias and fairness issues
* **IncidentResponseService:** Coordinates security incident response
* **ComplianceValidationService:** Verifies regulatory compliance
* **StakingService:** Implements economic security mechanisms

## Component Interaction Patterns

* **Event-Driven Communication:** Components communicate primarily through events
* **Command-Query Separation:** Clear distinction between commands and queries
* **Validation Chains:** Multi-stage validation for critical operations
* **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Automatic isolation of problematic components
* **Sidecar Security:** Security components attached to every service

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

* **Security:** Zero-trust security applied consistently across all components
* **Logging & Auditing:** Comprehensive activity recording in all components
* **Validation:** Input and output validation at all boundaries
* **Exception Handling:** Standardized error handling and reporting
* **Telemetry:** Performance and health monitoring throughout
