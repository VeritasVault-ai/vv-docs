* No operator onboarding without stake, regulatory checks, and cartel prevention
* All regulatory reports must be cryptographically signed and auditable

### Validation Rules

* Model validation includes both technical and business rule verification
* Fairness assessments must cover multiple metrics and protected attributes
* Compliance validation covers all applicable regulatory requirements
* Governance decisions require multi-level approval based on impact

### Performance Requirements

* Fairness evaluations completed within defined SLAs
* Compliance checks performed within regulatory timeframes
* Governance decisions tracked with response time metrics
* Monitoring alerts generated within seconds of threshold violations

## Domain Event Patterns

### Key Domain Events

* **ModelRegistered:** New model added to registry
* **DeploymentStatusChanged:** Model deployment status updated
