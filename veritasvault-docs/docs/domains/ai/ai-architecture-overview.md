# AI Architecture: Overview

> Core principles and architectural vision for VeritasVault's AI infrastructure

---

## 1. Architectural Vision

The AI architecture for VeritasVault is built on the fundamental premise that AI/ML systems in financial infrastructure must be held to the highest standards of security, auditability, and regulatory compliance while delivering cutting-edge capabilities. This vision manifests in an architecture that treats model governance, security, and compliance as first-class design concerns rather than afterthoughts.

## 2. Core Principles

### Security First

* **Zero Trust By Default:** No component is inherently trusted; all interactions require authentication and authorization
* **Defense in Depth:** Multiple security layers protect against compromised components
* **Cryptographic Provenance:** All artifacts, data, and model outputs are cryptographically signed and verified
* **Circuit Breakers:** Automated detection and remediation of anomalous behavior

### Auditability & Transparency

* **Complete Traceability:** Every model, parameter, training run, and inference is fully documented and traceable
* **Immutable Audit Trails:** Cryptographically secured, tamper-evident logs of all system activities
* **Explainability Requirements:** All production models must meet explainability standards appropriate to their risk level
* **Open Inspection:** Architecture enables third-party validation without compromising security

### Regulatory Compliance

* **Compliance by Design:** Regulatory requirements built into architecture, not bolted on
* **Automated Verification:** Continuous compliance checking throughout model lifecycle
* **Evidence Collection:** Automated gathering of compliance artifacts during normal operation
* **Flexible Reporting:** Adaptable to evolving regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions

### Resilience & Robustness

* **Guaranteed Rollback:** Every change can be safely reversed with minimal disruption
* **Geographic Redundancy:** Distributed across multiple regions for resilience
* **Operator Diversity:** Economic incentives ensure diverse operator set
* **Cartel Resistance:** Mechanisms to prevent collusion and centralization

## 3. Architectural Patterns

### Hexagonal Architecture

* **Domain-Centric Design:** Clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure
* **Port & Adapter Pattern:** Well-defined interfaces for all external interactions
* **Technology Independence:** Core domain logic isolated from specific technologies
* **Testability:** Domain logic can be tested independently of infrastructure

### Event-Driven Architecture

* **Event Sourcing:** System state derived from immutable sequence of events
* **Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** Separate write and read operations
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Non-blocking operations for better scalability
* **Temporal Queries:** Ability to reconstruct state at any point in time

### Pipeline-Based Processing

* **Well-Defined Stages:** Clear separation of concerns in model lifecycle
* **Quality Gates:** Explicit validation between stages
* **Parallelization:** Independent processing where possible
* **Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring at each stage

### Decentralized Control

* **Distributed Governance:** No single point of control or failure
* **Economic Security:** Operators have financial stake in system integrity
* **Consensus Mechanisms:** Critical operations require multi-party agreement
* **Progressive Decentralization:** Phased approach to increasing decentralization

## 4. Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **Model Lifecycle Management:** Registration, versioning, deployment, monitoring, retirement
* **Security Incident Management:** Detection, investigation, response, remediation
* **Fairness & Bias Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring and intervention for biased outputs
* **Regulatory Reporting:** Automated generation of compliance documentation
* **Operator Management:** Onboarding, staking, monitoring, slashing

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **Security:** Comprehensive protection against internal and external threats
* **Performance:** Efficient inference and training capabilities
* **Scalability:** Ability to handle growing model complexity and volume
* **Reliability:** High availability and fault tolerance
* **Maintainability:** Clear structure and documentation for long-term viability
* **Compatibility:** Integration with existing VeritasVault infrastructure

### Compliance Requirements

* **Model Risk Management:** Alignment with SR 11-7 and similar regulations
* **Data Protection:** Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations
* **Auditability:** Support for internal and external audits
* **Explainability:** Ability to explain model decisions to regulators and users
* **Fairness:** Mechanisms to detect and mitigate bias and discrimination

## 5. Constraints

### Technical Constraints

* **Performance Overhead:** Security and compliance mechanisms introduce performance costs
* **Compatibility Requirements:** Must integrate with existing VeritasVault infrastructure
* **Decentralization Trade-offs:** Balance between decentralization and operational efficiency
* **Resource Limitations:** Computational and storage constraints in distributed environments

### Regulatory Constraints

* **Varying Requirements:** Different jurisdictions may have conflicting requirements
* **Evolving Landscape:** Regulations around AI/ML in finance continue to develop
* **Explainability Challenges:** Some advanced models have inherent explainability limitations
* **Documentation Burden:** Extensive documentation requirements for regulated models

### Operational Constraints

* **Geographic Distribution:** Operators must be distributed across jurisdictions
* **Skill Requirements:** Specialized knowledge needed for secure AI operations
* **Backward Compatibility:** Support for existing models and integrations
* **Progressive Implementation:** Phased approach to full architectural vision

## 6. High-Level Architecture

The AI architecture consists of several interconnected layers, each with specific responsibilities:

### Infrastructure Layer

* **Compute Resources:** Distributed computation capabilities
* **Storage Systems:** Secure, redundant storage for models, data, and events
* **Network Infrastructure:** Secure communication between components
* **Identity & Access Management:** Authentication and authorization services

### Core Services Layer

* **Model Registry:** Central repository for all models and artifacts
* **Event Store:** Immutable record of all system events
* **Security Services:** Threat detection, validation, and response
* **Deployment Services:** Controlled promotion of models through environments

### Domain Services Layer

* **Lifecycle Management:** Controls model progression through stages
* **Fairness Monitoring:** Continuous evaluation of model bias and fairness
* **Compliance Services:** Regulatory reporting and verification
* **Governance Services:** Operator management and decentralized control

### Integration Layer

* **API Gateway:** Controlled access to AI capabilities
* **Event Bus:** Asynchronous communication between components
* **Data Integration:** Secure access to required data sources
* **External Services:** Connections to other VeritasVault domains

### Client Layer

* **Management Interfaces:** Tools for AI operators and administrators
* **Monitoring Dashboards:** Real-time visibility into system status
* **Reporting Tools:** Generation of compliance and operational reports
* **Developer Tools:** Support for model development and testing
