## Review Process Overview

The documentation review process follows these key stages:

1. **Planning**: Define scope and requirements for new content
2. **Creation**: Develop initial draft following style guide and templates
3. **Technical Review**: Verify technical accuracy and completeness
4. **Editorial Review**: Ensure clarity, consistency, and adherence to style guide
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Obtain feedback from relevant stakeholders
6. **Revision**: Address feedback and make necessary improvements
7. **Final Approval**: Obtain sign-off from documentation lead
8. **Publication**: Merge and deploy approved content
9. **Maintenance**: Monitor and update content as needed

## Submission Guidelines

### Content Planning

Before creating new documentation:

1. **Identify Need**: Determine the purpose and audience for the content
