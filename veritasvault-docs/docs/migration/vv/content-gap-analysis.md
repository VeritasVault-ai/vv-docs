## Priority Areas for Content Development

Based on the gap analysis, these are the highest priority areas for content development:

1. **Cross-Chain Interoperability** - Critical for multi-chain architecture understanding
2. **API Reference** - Essential for developer adoption
3. **Regulatory Compliance** - Important for enterprise adoption
4. **Governance Participation Guide** - Key for community engagement
5. **Architecture Overview Update** - Foundation for technical understanding
6. **Token Governance Details Update** - Critical for tokenomics understanding
7. **Technical Components Enhancement** - Important for implementation
8. **Security Architecture Enhancement** - Critical for security assurance
9. **Tokenomics Restructuring** - Important for clarity and consistency
