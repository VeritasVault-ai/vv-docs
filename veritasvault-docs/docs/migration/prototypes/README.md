# Docusaurus Component Prototypes

This directory contains prototype implementations of key components for the Docusaurus migration. These prototypes demonstrate how to implement our current React components as Docusaurus MDX components.

## Component Overview

### Section Components
- `SectionLevelOne` - Top-level section component
- `SectionLevelTwo` - Second-level section component
- `SectionLevelThree` - Third-level section component

### Content Components
- `ContentBlock` - General content container with variants
- `DiagramBlock` - Container for diagrams and images
- `InteractiveBlock` - Interactive tabbed content
- `CodeExampleBlock` - Code examples with tabs

### Utility Components
- `SectionAnchor` - Anchor links for sections
- `Badge` - Badge component for labels
- `CopyButton` - Button for copying code

## Usage

See `usage-examples.mdx` for detailed examples of how to use these components in MDX files.

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
Components are structured to be compatible with Docusaurus's MDX processing. They:
- Use Docusaurus theme components where possible
- Implement custom styling through CSS modules
- Support dark/light mode through Docusaurus theming

### Styling Approach
The styling approach uses:
- CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Tailwind-like utility classes for layout and spacing
- Docusaurus theme variables for colors and other theme properties

### Integration with Docusaurus
To use these components in a Docusaurus project:

1. Copy the component files to your Docusaurus project's `src/components` directory
2. Import and use the components in your MDX files
3. Customize the styling as needed to match your Docusaurus theme

## Next Steps

1. Test these components in an actual Docusaurus environment
2. Refine the styling to match your design system
3. Implement additional components as needed
4. Create a component library documentation page
