# Financial Modelling: The Black-Litterman Allocation Framework

## Overview
The **Veritas Vault** leverages a **Bayesian portfolio optimization framework** — the **Black-Litterman model** — to allocate liquidity across DeFi assets. This model balances **market equilibrium expectations** with **data-driven views**, ensuring both rational priors and adaptive intelligence steer capital.

The process integrates:
- **Market data ingestion**
- **View generation via signals or ML oracles**
- **Portfolio allocation using Black-Litterman mathematics**
- **Community governance (DAO)**
- **Vault execution of selected strategies**
