    ## Roadmap Overview

    The implementation of the multi-chain architecture follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one. This roadmap outlines the key milestones, deliverables, and timelines for the project.

    <Admonition type="note">
      This roadmap represents our current plans and is subject to adjustment based on technical developments, market conditions, and community feedback. We are committed to transparency and will communicate any significant changes to the roadmap.
    </Admonition>

    ## Phase 1: Foundation (Q3 2025 - Q1 2026)

    Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core infrastructure and initial functionality.
