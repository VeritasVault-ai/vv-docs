## AI Tools Usage

### Recommended AI Tools

- **Documentation Generation**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4
- **Code Examples**: GitHub Copilot, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Diagram Generation**: Mermaid with AI assistance
- **Image Creation**: DALL-E 3, Midjourney

### Effective Prompting

When using AI tools for documentation:

1. **Be specific**: Clearly define the technical context and audience level
2. **Provide examples**: Share existing documentation samples for stylistic consistency
3. **Use step-by-step instructions**: Break complex requests into smaller, focused prompts
4. **Review and refine**: Always review AI-generated content for accuracy and clarity

### Example Prompt Template

Generate [content type] about [topic] for VeritasVault documentation.

Context:

This is for [beginner/intermediate/advanced] developers
It relates to the [component name] component
It should follow our [specific style guideline]
Include:

[specific element 1]
[specific element 2]
[code examples in language]
Existing example for reference:
[paste example content]

Copy

## Commit Conventions

We follow the Conventional Commits specification with emoji for improved readability and organization.

### Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <emoji> <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types and Emojis

| Type | Emoji | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| feat | ✨ | A new feature |
| fix | 🐛 | A bug fix |
| docs | 📚 | Documentation only changes |
| style | 💎 | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc) |
| refactor | ♻️ | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| perf | ⚡️ | A code change that improves performance |
| test | 🧪 | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| build | 🛠️ | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| ci | 👷 | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts |
| chore | 🧹 | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| revert | ⏪ | Reverts a previous commit |

### Examples

```text
feat(auth): ✨ Add new OAuth2 authentication flow

docs(readme): 📚 Update installation instructions

fix(api): 🐛 Fix incorrect response status code in login endpoint

refactor(core): ♻️ Simplify document validation logic

chore(deps): 🧹 Update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Documentation Style

### Voice and Tone

- Use active voice
- Be concise and clear
- Use second person ("you") to address the reader
- Maintain a professional but approachable tone

### Structure

- Use hierarchical headings (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Start with an overview/introduction
- Group related content under appropriate headings
- End with next steps or related resources

### Code Examples

- Include practical, working code examples
- Comment code to explain key concepts
- Use syntax highlighting
- Provide complete examples that can be copied and used directly

## Content Generation Guidelines

When using AI to generate documentation content:

1. **Accuracy**: Verify all technical details against source code or specifications
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all necessary steps and information are included
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and style with existing docs
4. **Clarity**: Prioritize clear explanations over technical jargon
5. **Audience-appropriate**: Tailor content to the intended audience's expertise level

## Code Generation Guidelines

When using AI to generate code examples:

1. **Functionality**: Ensure code examples are functional and error-free
2. **Best Practices**: Follow VeritasVault coding standards and best practices
3. **Security**: Review for potential security issues
4. **Simplicity**: Keep examples focused and minimal while demonstrating the concept
5. **Consistency**: Match the style of existing code examples

## Review Process

All AI-generated content should go through the following review process:

1. **Technical accuracy review**: Verify technical details and functionality
2. **Style and consistency review**: Ensure adherence to documentation standards
3. **User experience review**: Evaluate from the perspective of the target audience
4. **Final review**: Comprehensive check before publication

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously refine our AI usage guidelines based on:

1. **User feedback**: Incorporate reader suggestions and questions
2. **Analytics**: Track which documentation pages need improvement
3. **AI advancements**: Update practices as AI capabilities evolve
4. **Team learning**: Share effective prompting techniques and workflows
